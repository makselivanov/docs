# Access management in {{ dns-name }}

In this section, you will learn:
* [Which resources you can assign a role for](#resources).
* [Which roles exist in the service](#roles-list).
* [Which roles are required](#required-roles) for particular actions.

{% include [about-access-management](../../_includes/iam/about-access-management.md) %}

Roles for a resource can be assigned by users who have the `dns.admin` role or one of the following roles for that resource:

{% include [roles-list](../../_includes/iam/roles-list.md) %}

## Which resources you can assign a role for {#resources}

{% include [basic-resources](../../_includes/iam/basic-resources-for-access-control.md) %}

You can assign a role for a [DNS zone](../concepts/dns-zone.md) through the YC CLI or {{ yandex-cloud }} API.

## What roles do I need {#required-roles}

The table below lists the roles required to perform a particular action. You can always assign a role offering more permissions than the one specified. For example, assign `editor` instead of `viewer` or `dns.admin` instead of `dns.editor`.
