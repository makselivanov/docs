# Generating an image using {{ yandexart-name }}

{% include notitle [preview-stage](../../../_includes/foundation-models/yandexgpt/preview.md) %}

With {{ yandexart-name }}, you can generate images in [asynchronous mode](../../concepts/index.md#working-mode). In response to an asynchronous request, the model will return an [Operation object](../../../api-design-guide/concepts/operation.md) containing an operation ID, which you can use to [track its execution](../../../api-design-guide/concepts/operation.md#monitoring) and get the result after generation is completed. Generating a result in asynchronous mode can take from a couple of minutes to several hours.

## Getting started {#before-begin}

To run sample requests using the API, install:

* [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se) to send API requests
* [jq](https://github.com/jqlang/jq) utility to work with JSON files

Get API authentication credentials as described on the [{#T}](../../api-ref/authentication.md) page.

To improve the quality of responses, {{ yandexart-name }} logs user prompts. Do not use sensitive information and personal data in your prompts.

  1. Create a request body file, e.g., `prompt.json`:

     ```json
     {
     "modelUri": "art://<folder_ID>/yandex-art/latest",
     "generationOptions": {
       "seed": "1863",
       "aspectRatio": {
          "widthRatio": "2",
          "heightRatio": "1"
        }
     },
     "messages": [
       {
         "weight": "1",
         "text": "a pattern of pastel colored succulents of various sorts, hd full wallpaper, sharp focus, many intricate details, picture depth, top view"
       }
     ]
     }
     ```

     {% include [api-parameters](../../../_includes/foundation-models/yandexart/api-parameters.md) %}

  1. To send a request to the neural network using the [ImageGenerationAsync.generate](../../image-generation/api-ref/ImageGenerationAsync/generate.md) method, run the following command:

     ```bash
     curl --request POST \
       -H "Authorization: Bearer <IAM_token_value>" \
       -d "@prompt.json" \
       "https://llm.{{ api-host }}/foundationModels/v1/imageGenerationAsync"
     ```

     Where:

     * `<IAM_token_value>`: Your account's IAM token.
     * `prompt.json`: JSON file with request parameters.

     In response, the service will return the Operation object:

     ```json
     {"id":"fbveu1sntj**********","description":"","createdAt":null,"createdBy":"","modifiedAt":null,"done":false,"metadata":null}
     ```

     Save the operation `id` you get in the response.

  1. Generating an image may take from a few seconds to a few hours. Wait for a while and send a request to `https://llm.api.cloud.yandex.net:443/operations/<operation_ID>` to get the generation result. When the image is ready, you will get the result in a [Base64-encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) file named `image.jpeg`.

     ```bash
     curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer <IAM_token_value>" https://llm.api.cloud.yandex.net:443/operations/<operation_ID> | jq -r '.response | .image' | base64 -d > image.jpeg
     ```

     Where:

     * `<IAM_token_value>`: IAM token you got [before you started](#before-begin).
     * `<operation_ID>`: The `id` field value obtained in response to the generation request.

{% endlist %}
