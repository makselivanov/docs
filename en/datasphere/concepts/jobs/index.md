# {{ ml-platform-name }} Jobs

In {{ ml-platform-name }}, you can run jobs, i.e., computations on {{ ml-platform-name }} VMs outside {{ jlab }}Lab, remotely. These can be Python scripts and projects, Bash scripts, and executable binary files compiled for Linux x86_64.

Jobs are created and run in [projects](../project.md). However, they do not depend on project notebooks and running VMs.

To use {{ ml-platform-name }} Jobs, [authenticate](../../operations/projects/authentication.md) as a user account.

Before [running a job](../../operations/projects/work-with-jobs.md), set up a Python virtual environment, install [{{ ds-cli }}](cli.md) using the `pip install datasphere` command, and prepare a configuration file describing all the parameters for running the job. You can also [install](../../../cli/quickstart.md) and configure the [{{ yandex-cloud }} CLI](../../../cli/) to use it for authentication in {{ yandex-cloud }}.

{% include [vscode-extension-info](../../../_includes/datasphere/vscode-extension-info.md) %}

You can find jobs in the **{{ ml-platform-name }} Jobs** tab of a project. Their progress and results will be available under **Run history**.

{% note tip %}

For long-running jobs, we recommend saving intermediate results in an S3 object storage.

## Storing job data

{{ ml-platform-name }} Jobs stores input data cache, environments, logs, and job execution results. You can reuse the data and share it across jobs in a single project. This means repeated runs of the same job will not load input data into {{ ml-platform-name }} each time but will reuse the data loaded on the first run.

The size of stored data is limited. For more information about {{ ml-platform-name }} limits, see [{#T}](../limits.md).

The default job data lifetime is 14 days. You can change this value using {{ ds-cli }}:

```bash
datasphere project job set-data-ttl --id <job_ID> --days <lifetime_in_days>
```

## Job configuration file {#config}

When creating a job, specify its parameters in the `config.yaml` file: a [configuration of computing resources](../configurations.md) that will be used for job execution and required files with input data. Depending on the settings specified in the configuration file, {{ ml-platform-name }} analyzes the job, identifies dependencies, [deploys the environment](environment.md) on the VM, and runs the job code. Job execution results are saved in the {{ ml-platform-name }} project files listed in the job configuration.

```yaml
# Job name
name: simple-python-script
# Job description
desc: Program description

# Entry point parameters to run computations
cmd: >  # multi-line YAML string
  python3 src/main.py
    --params ${PARAMS}
    --features ${<connector_ID>}/features.tsv
    --validate ${CIFAR}/val.json
    --normalizer ${DS_PROJECT_HOME}/misc/norm.bin
    --model ${MODEL}
    --epochs 5

# Input data diles
inputs:
  - misc/logging.yaml  # File path relative to the job run directory on local computer
  - /usr/share/params.json: # Absolute file path on local computer is saved to the PARAMS variable
      var: PARAMS

# Files with results
outputs:
  - data/model.bin: MODEL  # Relative file path is saved to the MODEL variable
  - other/metrics.png  # Relative file path

# Resources required for running the job must be available in the project
s3-mounts: # S3 connectors
  - <connector_ID>   # S3 connector ID
                           # No connector name is set, so the connector can be accessed by ID
datasets:
  - <dataset_ID>:  # ID of the available project dataset
      var: CIFAR   # CIFAR is a variable to access the dataset

# Environment parameters
env:
  vars:  # Environment variables
    - DEVICE_COUNT: 8    # Environment variable can be specified explicitly
    - PYTHONBUFFERED     # if the parameter is not specified, its value will be determined from the current environment
  docker: <Docker_image_ID>  # Docker image available in the project {{ ml-platform-name }}
  # You can also specify a Docker image in an image registry
  # docker:
  #   image: <image_path_in_registry>:<tag>  # For example, <{{ registry }}/crtabcdef12345678900/myenv:0.1>
                                              # For Docker Hub, it is enough to specify `<name>:<tag>`, e.g., `ubuntu:focal`
  #   username: <username>
  #   password:
  #     secret-id: PASSWORD  # {{ ml-platform-name }} secret ID

  # Environment dependency build method
  python: auto # Fully automated environment build

  # python: # Environment parameters are set manually. If no parameters are specified, their values will be determined from the current environment automatically
  #   type: manual

  #   requirements-file: requirements.txt  # File with environment parameters

# Job run flags
flags:
  - attach-project-disk # Mount the project storage

# Computing resource configuration for running the job
cloud-instance-types:
  - g2.1 # Priority configuration
  - g1.1 # Second priority configuration

# Extended working directory configuration

```

The job `config.yaml` file contains multiple sections.

1. The `name` and `description` sections specify the job name and description. The job name must be unique within the project. A description is optional and helps find the required job in the project.

1. The `cmd` section specifies the job entry point. Specify how to run your code and set all the run parameters to be provided to the executable file or script. You can use variables and IDs that will be specified in the sections below to set paths to the required files.

1. The `input` section specifies files with input data and other information to be provided for running the job from your local computer. You can set a file path relative to the job directory or save the relative or absolute file path to a variable to use it in other sections of the configuration file.

1. The `output` section specifies files to save the computation results to. Once the job is executed, these files will appear on your PC. The rules for setting file paths are the same as in the `input` section.

1. {{ ml-platform-name }} resources used in jobs are specified in the `s3-mounts` (for [S3 connectors](../s3-connector.md)) and `datasets`(for [datasets](../dataset.md)) sections. To use an S3 connector or a dataset in a job, specify the ID of an available project resource and, optionally, define a variable for it. If no variable is set, resources in the `cmd` section can be accessed by their ID.

   You can also use project storage in your job. To do this, set the `attach-project-disk` flag in the `flags` section. The project storage will be mounted to the VM the job is running on as an external disk for data reads. The storage path will be available in the `DS_PROJECT_HOME` environment variable.

1. The `env` section defines environment parameters for running the job: the VM environment build method, environment variables and, optionally, a Docker image built in {{ ml-platform-name }} or stored in a different image registry. You can specify the registry authorization credentials if needed.

   There are two ways to set up the environment for your Python projects:

   * Allow {{ ml-platform-name }} to automatically identify all required dependencies, analyze the current environment on your local computer, and build and migrate the environment. To enable this option, set `python: auto` in the `env` section.
   * You yourself can specify the Python interpreter version and the libraries you are going to use directly in the configuration file or a separate `requirements.txt` file. If you explicitly set at least one parameter, the missing ones will be fetched from the current environment automatically.

   {% note warning %}

   If you set up the environment in auto mode or specify only some of the dependencies, run your job from the Python virtual environment with all the current packages and local modules installed. This will enable the `datasphere` library to automatically identify the job runtime environment parameters.

   {% endnote %}

   The environment variables are specified in the `vars` section under `env`. Project secrets will also be added to the environment variables when running the job.

   {% include [jobs-info](../../../_includes/datasphere/jobs-environment.md) %}

1. The `cloud-instance-types` section defines the valid [computing resource configuration](../configurations.md) types the job can run on. Configurations are specified in order of priority, i.e., if resources are available, the job will use the first configuration to run. If there are no VMs with the first configuration available, the job will try to run on the second one, then the third, and so on.

   If you only have a single configuration, you may also use the old `cloud-instance-type` field, e.g., `cloud-instance-type: g1.1`; however, it is preferable to use the new one.

1. The `working-storage` section defines the extended working directory parameters. By default, the working directory is created on the system disk. The directory's size is not guaranteed and is usually about 20 GB. If you need more space to complete the job, you can specify this explicitly. The extended working directory can range in size from 100 GB to 10 TB.

   You pay for the extended working directory specified in the `working-storage` section according to the [data storage pricing policy](../../pricing.md#prices-jobs).
