# {{ alb-name }} Ingress controller operation principles


An [{{ alb-name }} Ingress controller for {{ managed-k8s-name }}](index.md) has two [pods](../../../managed-kubernetes/concepts/index.md#pod):

* The primary `yc-alb-ingress-controller-*` pod is responsible for creating and updating {{ alb-name }} resources. You can use its logs to follow the operations with the resources.
* The `yc-alb-ingress-controller-hc-*` [health check](../../concepts/backend-group.md#health-checks) pod with a container receives health check requests from the L7 load balancer on TCP port `10501` and health checks [kube-proxy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-proxy/) pods on each cluster node. If kube-proxy is healthy, then, even if an application in a particular pod does not respond, {{ k8s }} will redirect traffic to a different pod with that application or to a different node. This is the default health check workflow for the {{ alb-name }} Ingress controller. You can also [configure your own health checks](../../../managed-kubernetes/tutorials/custom-health-checks.md) in the [HttpBackendGroup](../../k8s-ref/http-backend-group.md) resource parameters.

{% note warning %}

Do not manually update {{ alb-name }} resources created by the controller's primary pod. Any changes you make will be rolled back automatically. Use the standard {{ managed-k8s-name }} cluster control methods instead.

{% endnote %}

The primary pod manages the {{ alb-name }} resource architecture using the following principles:

* Load balancers and HTTP routers to accept and distribute traffic to backend groups are created based on [Ingress](../../k8s-ref/ingress.md) resources.

  If several `Ingress` resources have the same `ingress.alb.yc.io/group-name` annotation values, they are combined into a single load balancer.

  * For a load balancer to accept HTTPS traffic, the `spec.tls` field in the `Ingress` description must specify the domain names and the certificate IDs from {{ certificate-manager-name }}:

    ```yaml
    spec:
      tls:
        - hosts:
            - <domain_name>
          secretName: yc-certmgr-cert-id-<certificate_ID>
    ```

    Where `secretName` is the reference to the certificate from {{ certificate-manager-full-name }}.

    This will create two types of listeners for the load balancer: some will accept HTTPS traffic on port `443`, while the others will redirect HTTP requests (port `80`) to HTTPS with the `301 Moved Permanently` status code. The traffic distribution rules for the same domain names explicitly specified in other `Ingress` resources, without the `spec.tls` field, will be prioritized over HTTP-to-HTTPS redirects.

    {% include [k8s-ingress-controller-secret-name](../../../_includes/application-load-balancer/k8s-ingress-controller-secret-name.md) %}
    
  * If there is no `spec.tls` field in the `Ingress` description, only listeners for incoming HTTP traffic on port `80` will be created for the load balancer.

* You can create backend groups to process incoming traffic:

  * Based on {{ k8s }} services referenced in `Ingress` [rules](../../../application-load-balancer/k8s-ref/ingress.md#rule) directly. This method is useful if you need to bind a simple backend group consisting of a single service to a route.

    In [ALB Ingress Controller](/marketplace/products/yc/alb-ingress-controller) versions prior to 0.2.0, each backend group corresponds to a bundle of `host`, `http.paths.path`, and `http.paths.pathType` parameters. In versions 0.2.0 and later, the backend group corresponds to the `backend.service` parameter. This may cause collisions when updating the ALB Ingress Controller. To avoid them, [find out whether upgrade restrictions apply](../../operations/k8s-ingress-controller-upgrade.md) to your infrastructure.

  * Based on [HttpBackendGroup](../../k8s-ref/http-backend-group.md) resources that support explicit backend group descriptions. These are [custom resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/) from the `alb.yc.io` API group provided by an Ingress controller.

    You should refer to `HttpBackendGroup` in the `Ingress` rules, same as to services (`spec.rules[*].http.paths[*].backend.resource`).

    {% include [k8s-ingress-controller-backend-group-features](../../../_includes/application-load-balancer/k8s-ingress-controller-backend-group-features.md) %}

* Services referenced in `Ingress` or `HttpBackendGroup` are deployed to backends. These can be configured using [Service](../../k8s-ref/service-for-ingress.md) resources.

## Mapping between {{ alb-name }} and {{ k8s }} resources {#mapping}

| {{ alb-name }} | {{ k8s }} |
| ----- | ----- |
| [Load balancer](../../concepts/application-load-balancer.md) | [Ingress](../../k8s-ref/ingress.md) resources with identical `ingress.alb.yc.io/group-name` annotation values |
| HTTP router [virtual hosts](../../concepts/http-router.md#virtual-host) | `Ingress.spec.rules` |
| Virtual host [routes](../../concepts/http-router.md#routes) | `Ingress.spec.rules[*].http.paths` |
| [Backend group](../../concepts/backend-group.md) | [HttpBackendGroup](../../k8s-ref/http-backend-group.md) or [services](../../k8s-ref/service-for-ingress.md) |
| [Target group](../../concepts/target-group.md) | Cluster [node group](../../../managed-kubernetes/concepts/index.md#node-group) |

## IDs of load balancer resources in a {{ k8s }} cluster {#alb-ids}

IDs of resources of an {{ alb-name }} load balancer deployed in the `Ingress` configuration are specified in the custom `IngressGroupStatus` resource of the {{ managed-k8s-name }} cluster. To view them:

{% list tabs group=instructions %}

- Management console {#console}

  1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select the folder where the required {{ managed-k8s-name }} cluster was created.
  1. In the list of services, select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.iam.folder.dashboard.label_managed-kubernetes }}**.
  1. Select the {{ managed-k8s-name }} cluster whose `Ingress` configuration was used to create the load balancer.
  1. On the {{ managed-k8s-name }} cluster page, go to the ![shapes-3](../../../_assets/console-icons/shapes-3.svg)Â **{{ ui-key.yacloud.k8s.cluster.switch_custom-resources }}** tab.
  1. Select `ingressgroupstatuses.alb.yc.io` and go to the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.k8s.custom-resources.label_tab-resources }}** tab.
  1. Select a resource with the `Ingress` resource group name specified in the `ingress.alb.yc.io/group-name` annotation and go to the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.k8s.workloads.label_tab-yaml }}** tab.

- kubectl CLI {#kubectl}

  1. {% include [kubectl-install-links](../../../_includes/managed-kubernetes/kubectl-install.md) %}
  1. Run this command:

      ```bash
      kubectl describe IngressGroupStatus
      ```
