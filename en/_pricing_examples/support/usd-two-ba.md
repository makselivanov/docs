An organization with the Business service plan activated pays for resources from different billing accounts:

* Account 1: Consumes $400.00 worth of resources a month.
* Account 2: Consumes $80.00 worth of resources a month.

The fixed amount will only be paid by one of the accounts, e.g., Account 1.

The cost of support will be:

* $24.00 + $400.00 * 0.05 = $44.00 for Account 1.
* $80.00 * 0.05 = $4.00 for Account 2.
