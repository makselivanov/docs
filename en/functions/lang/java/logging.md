# Java function runtime logging

{{ sf-name }} automatically captures an application's standard output streams and sends them to the centralized logging system in {{ yandex-cloud }}. Along with application runtime logging, the system logs request execution events.

Additional messages are logged using standard language constructs:
1. `System.out.println`: Outputs a message to the standard output stream, `stdout`.
1. `System.err.println`: Outputs a message to the standard error stream, `stderr`.
1. `Instant.now` + `Duration.between` (and other methods): Returns the action duration.
