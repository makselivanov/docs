# Installing and running {{ unified-agent-full-name }}

## List of supported operating systems {#supported-os}

{{ unified-agent-short-name }} is supported by the following operating systems:

- Ubuntu 14.04 or higher (it can be [installed using any method](#setup))
- Debian 9 or higher (Docker image, deb package, or binary file)
- CentOS 7 or higher (Docker image)
- Fedora 32 or higher (Docker image)
- Fedora CoreOS (Docker image)

## Before you begin installation {#before-you-begin}

Prior to installing {{ unified-agent-full-name }}, follow these steps:

1. Create a VM in {{ yandex-cloud }} or a host outside {{ yandex-cloud }} on one of the [supported operating systems](#supported-os), for example, Ubuntu 14.04 or older.

1. (Optional) [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) if you want to use Docker to run {{ unified-agent-short-name }}. Docker is pre-installed in Fedora CoreOS.
   - Set up a public IPv4 address (recommended).
   - [Configure Docker to work with IPv6](https://docs.docker.com/config/daemon/ipv6) and [enable network address translation](https://medium.com/@skleeschulte/how-to-enable-ipv6-for-docker-containers-on-ubuntu-18-04-c68394a219a2) if you cannot use a public IPv4 address.

1. [Create a service account](../../../../iam/operations/sa/create.md) in the folder you want to write metrics to and [assign it](../../../../iam/operations/sa/assign-role-for-sa.md) the `{{ roles-monitoring-editor }}` role.

1. Set up agent authorization in the {{ monitoring-full-name }} API:
   - If the agent is installed on a VM in {{ yandex-cloud }}, [link the service account you created](../../../../compute/operations/vm-connect/auth-inside-vm.md#link-sa-with-instance) to the VM. In that case, the agent will automatically receive the service account IAM token from the metadata service.
   - If the agent is installed on a host outside {{ yandex-cloud }}, [create an authorized key](../../../../iam/operations/authorized-key/create.md) for service accounts. For more information about delivering metrics from hosts outside {{ yandex-cloud }}, see [{#T}](../../../operations/unified-agent/non-yc.md).

## Installation {#setup}

Install {{ unified-agent-short-name }} using one of the following methods:

{% list tabs group=unified_agent %}

- Docker image {#docker}

  {{ unified-agent-short-name }} is distributed as a Docker image. The image is published in the `{{ registry }}/yc` repository with the `unified_agent` name and the `latest` tag. The image includes a binary file with the agent and a configuration file used to set up the agent [for Linux system metric delivery](../../../operations/unified-agent/linux_metrics.md) in {{ monitoring-full-name }}.

  {% note warning %}

  To monitor secondary disks attached to the host, specify the paths to their mount points using the `-v` parameter of the `docker run` command. For more information, see [{#T}](./inputs.md#linux_metrics_input).

  {% endnote %}

  The agent's configuration file is located at `/etc/yandex/unified_agent/config.yml` and parameterized by environment variables. For more information about starting a Docker container, see [below](#configure-docker).

  To start a container with the agent, run the following command:

  ```bash
    sudo docker run \
      -p 16241:16241 -it --detach --uts=host \
      --name=ua \
      -v /proc:/ua_proc \
      -e PROC_DIRECTORY=/ua_proc \
      -e FOLDER_ID=a1bs81qpemb4******** \
      {{ registry }}/yc/unified-agent
  ```

  Where `FOLDER_ID` is the ID of the folder to write metrics to.

  To launch a container with its own configuration file, add the `-v` parameter to the container start command and specify the _full path_ to the configuration file. Before running a container, delete the following lines from the configuration file:

  ```yaml
  import:
  - /etc/yandex/unified_agent/conf.d/*.yml
  ```

  Sample run container command using a custom configuration file:

  ```bash
    docker run \
      -p 16241:16241 -it --detach --uts=host \
      --name=ua \
      -v /proc:/ua_proc \
      -v `pwd`/config.yml:/etc/yandex/unified_agent/conf.d/config.yml \
      --entrypoint="" \
      -e PROC_DIRECTORY=/ua_proc \
      -e FOLDER_ID=a1bs81qpemb4******** \
      {{ registry }}/yc/unified-agent
  ```

  By default, the [status](services.md#status) section of the agent's configuration file specifies `host: null`. Please keep this in mind if you are using your own configuration file.

  For more information about agent configuration, see [{#T}](./configuration.md).

- deb package {#deb}

  {{ unified-agent-short-name }} is distributed as a deb package for Ubuntu 14.04 or higher. The package contains a binary file with the agent and an empty configuration file located at `/etc/yandex/unified_agent/config.yml`.

  To download the latest version of the agent's deb package, run:

  ```bash
  ubuntu_name="ubuntu-14.04-trusty" ua_version=$(curl -s https://{{ s3-storage-host }}/yc-unified-agent/latest-version) bash -c 'curl -s -O https://{{ s3-storage-host }}/yc-unified-agent/releases/${ua_version}/deb/${ubuntu_name}/yandex-unified-agent_${ua_version}_amd64.deb'
  ```

  Supported values for the `ubuntu_name` parameter:
  * `ubuntu-14.04-trusty`
  * `ubuntu-16.04-xenial`
  * `ubuntu-18.04-bionic`
  * `ubuntu-20.04-focal`
  * `ubuntu-22.04-jammy`, starting with version `23.03.02`

  To find out all the available versions of the agent, run this command:
  ```(bash)
  curl -s https://{{ s3-storage-host }}/yc-unified-agent/all-versions
  ```

  To install the deb package, run this command:

  ```bash
  sudo dpkg -i yandex-unified-agent_21.02.03_amd64.deb
  ```

  To make sure {{ unified-agent-short-name }} is successfully installed and running, run the `systemctl status unified-agent` command. Command output example:

  ```bash
  user@my-vm:~$ systemctl status unified-agent
  ● unified-agent.service - Yandex Unified Agent service
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/unified-agent.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)

             └─141403 /usr/bin/unified_agent --config /etc/yandex/unified_agent/config.yml --log-priority NOTICE
  ```

  After installing the package, edit the `/etc/yandex/unified_agent/config.yml` configuration file, e.g., by setting up the agent for [delivering Linux system metrics](../../../operations/unified-agent/linux_metrics.md). For more information about agent configuration, see [{#T}](./configuration.md).

- Binary file {#binary}

  {{ unified-agent-short-name }} is distributed as a binary file built for the x86-64/amd64 architecture for Ubuntu 14.04 or higher.

  To download the latest version of the agent's binary file, run:

  ```bash
  ua_version=$(curl -s https://{{ s3-storage-host }}/yc-unified-agent/latest-version) bash -c 'curl -s -O https://{{ s3-storage-host }}/yc-unified-agent/releases/$ua_version/unified_agent && chmod +x ./unified_agent'
  ```

  To find out all the available versions of the agent, run this command:
  ```(bash)
  curl -s https://{{ s3-storage-host }}/yc-unified-agent/all-versions
  ```

  Download the agent's executable file and then create a configuration file, for example, with the settings for [delivering Linux system metrics](../../../operations/unified-agent/linux_metrics.md). For more information about agent configuration, see [{#T}](./configuration.md).

  To run the agent, run the following command:

  ```bash
  ./unified_agent --config unified_agent.yml
  ```

  Where `--config` is the configuration file path.

- When creating a VM {#vm}

  You can install {{ unified-agent-short-name }} when creating a VM through the management console, CLI, API, or {{ TF }}.

  To install the agent from the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), enable **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.instances.create.unified-agent }}** under **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.instances.create.section_monitoring }}**.

  To install the agent via the CLI or API, provide the following string in the [user metadata](../../../../compute/concepts/vm-metadata.md#how-to-send-metadata) (`user-data`):

  ```text
  #cloud-config\nruncmd:\n  - wget -O - https://monitoring.{{ api-host }}/monitoring/v2/unifiedAgent/config/install.sh | bash
  ```
  To install the agent using {{ TF }}, add this metadata to the configuration file:

  ```hcl
  resource "yandex_compute_instance" "this" {
  ...
  resources {
    ...
  }

  ...

  metadata = {
    ssh-keys = "<username>:<SSH_key_contents>",
    "install-unified-agent": "1"
  }
  }
  ```

  To install the agent and send metrics, make sure the VM has access to the internet.

  The agent is installed with a default configuration file located at `/etc/yandex/unified_agent/config.yml`.

  The configuration file is set up to send [basic virtual machine metrics](./inputs.md#linux_metrics_input) and [agent health metrics](./inputs.md#agent_metrics_input). You will be [charged](../../../pricing.md) for metric delivery.

  You can also [configure](./configuration.md) the delivery of custom metrics or [logs to {{ cloud-logging-name }}](./outputs.md#yc_logs_output).

  You are responsible for updating and maintaining the agent.
