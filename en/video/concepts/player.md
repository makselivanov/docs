# Video Player

[Broadcasts](./streams.md) and [videos](./videos.md) are played in {{ video-name }} in an integrated _video player_.

The support for [Cloud Video Player SDK for IFrame](../iframe-sdk.md) allows users to embed the video player to an HTML page. We are planning to add SDKs for iOS, Android, and JavaScript in future.

## Example of video player embedding on a page {#example}

<iframe
    frameborder="0"
    scrolling="no"
    allowfullscreen
    allow="autoplay; fullscreen; encrypted-media; accelerometer; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; web-share"
    src="https://runtime.video.cloud.yandex.net/player/video/vplvmyqsxi7dlwndvb4y?autoplay=1&mute=true"
></iframe>
