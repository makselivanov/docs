## Video viewing statistics {#video-statistics}

For each video, you can [look up the viewing statistics](../operations/video/get-statistics.md) and flexibly customize the statistics period.

The following viewing statistics are currently available:

* Number of views: Integer.
* Share of viewed content: Percentage ratio of average viewing time to video duration.
* Total viewing time: Total viewing time in hours and minutes.
* Average viewing time: Average viewing time in hours and minutes.
* Linear chart with distribution of the number of views per unit of time with the following discretization levels:

    * `5 minutes`
    * `1 hour`
    * `1 day`
* Pie chart with distribution of views by device OS type.
* Pie chart with distribution of views by device type.
* [Heat map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_map) with data on video fragment views.

    Each point on the heat map corresponds to a 30-second video fragment.

    On the heat map, the fact of video fragment playback is counted as a view regardless of playback duration. For example, if you start a video and stop it right away, a view will be counted for the first fragment of the video.
