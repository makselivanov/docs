# Adding a member

{% list tabs group=instructions %}

- {{ video-name }} interface {#console}

   1. Open the {{ video-name }} [home page]({{ link-video-main }}).
   1. Click **{{ ui-key.yacloud_video.dashboard.action_add-user }}** to invite a user to an [organization](../../organization/quickstart.md). In the window that opens:

      1. Enter the email address of the user you want to invite to the organization, e.g., `login@yandex.ru`.

         You can specify multiple email addresses separated by commas to [invite](../../organization/operations/add-account.md#send-invitation) several users in one go.
      1. Click **{{ ui-key.yacloud_components.organization.action_send-invitation }}**.
   1. Once the user has accepted the invitation and joined the organization, click **{{ ui-key.yacloud_video.dashboard.action_go-to-org }}** and [assign](../../organization/operations/add-role.md) the required [roles](../security/index.md#service-roles) to the new user.

      For example, you can assign the `video.editor` role to create, modify, and delete {{ video-full-name }} resources and to stream video or the `video.viewer` role only to view the resources.

   {{ video-name }} will become available to the users you invite after they accept the invitation and get the required permissions to use {{ video-full-name }}.
