# Access management in {{ video-full-name }}

User access to {{ video-name }} depends on relevant permissions granted within an organization. Organizations are managed using [{{ org-full-name }}](../../organization/).

The operations available to {{ video-name }} users are determined by their roles. You can assign roles to a Yandex account, [federated users](../../iam/concepts/federations.md), [user group](../../organization/operations/manage-groups.md), [system group](../../iam/concepts/access-control/system-group.md), or [public group](../../iam/concepts/access-control/public-group.md). For more information about managing access to {{ yandex-cloud }}, see [{#T}](../../iam/concepts/access-control/index.md).

Roles for a resource can be assigned by users who have the `video.admin` role or one of the following roles for that resource:
