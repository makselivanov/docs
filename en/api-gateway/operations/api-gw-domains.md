# Connecting a domain

You can connect your own domain to access the API gateway. You can connect a wildcard domain, e.g., `*.example.com`, to the API gateway for it to handle requests for all `example.com` subdomains. You can also connect multiple domains. The domain will be identified by the `Host` header.

{% note warning %}

If a third-party DNS provider manages your domain, it must be a third-level domain or lower. For example, you can connect the `www.example.com` domain, but not `example.com`. This has to do with how CNAME records are processed on DNS hostings. Learn more in [RFC 1912, section 2.4](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1912.txt).

To use the second-level domain, such as `example.com`, delegate it to [{{ dns-full-name }}](../../dns/) and create an [ANAME record](../../dns/concepts/resource-record.md#aname) in the DNS zone.

To connect a domain to an API gateway:

{% list tabs group=instructions %}

- Management console {#console}

    1. Add a CNAME record to your DNS provider or to your own DNS server:
    
        ```text
        <domain> IN CNAME <API_gateway_service_domain>
        ```

        To find out an API gateway's service domain:

       1. Go to the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}).
       1. Select the folder where the API gateway is located, and in the service list, select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.iam.folder.dashboard.label_api-gateway }}**.
       1. Select the API gateway.
       1. You can see the service domain under **{{ ui-key.yacloud.serverless-functions.gateways.overview.section_base }}**.

        Domain names must end in a dot.

        To use a top-level domain or higher, delegate it to [{{ dns-full-name }}](../../dns/) and create an [ANAME record](../../dns/operations/resource-record-create.md) in the DNS zone. You can create a record in {{ dns-full-name }} both before and after creating the domain. For more information, see step 6.

    1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select the folder containing the API gateway.

    1. In the list of services, select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.iam.folder.dashboard.label_certificate-manager }}** and:

        1. Add a [Let's Encrypt<sup>®</sup> certificate](../../certificate-manager/operations/managed/cert-create.md) or a [custom certificate](../../certificate-manager/operations/import/cert-create.md) for the domain to connect.

            {% note info %}

            Be sure to timely update your certificates. For more info, refer to our guides on [updating Let's Encrypt<sup>®</sup> certificates](../../certificate-manager/operations/managed/cert-update.md) and [custom certificates](../../certificate-manager/operations/import/cert-update.md).

            {% endnote %}

        1. Wait until the certificate status switches to `Issued`.
    
    1. Go back to the folder page.

    1. In the list of services, select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.iam.folder.dashboard.label_api-gateway }}** and:

        1. Select the API gateway.
        1. In the window that opens, go to ![image](../../_assets/api-gateway/domain-icon.svg) **{{ ui-key.yacloud.serverless-functions.gateways.item.switch_domains }}**.
        1. Click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.serverless-functions.gateways.domains.button_add }}**, select a certificate, and enter a domain name (FQDN).

    1. If you skipped step 1 and did not add a CNAME record, create an ANAME record in {{ dns-full-name }}:

        1. Click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.component.dns-integration.button_add-domain }}** in the domain row.
        1. If you do not have a DNS zone with the same name as the domain, create one. To do this, click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.dns.button_zone-create }}**.
        1. Select a different value in the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.dns.label_form-ttl }}** field, if required.
        1. Click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.common.create }}**.
        
- API {#api}

  To add a domain to an API gateway, use the [addDomain](../apigateway/api-ref/ApiGateway/addDomain.md) REST API method for the [ApiGateway](../apigateway/api-ref/ApiGateway/index.md) resource or the [ApiGatewayService/AddDomain](../apigateway/api-ref/grpc/apigateway_service.md#AddDomain) gRPC API call.
