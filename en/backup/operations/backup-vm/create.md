# Creating a VM backup

To create a backup of your VM, [connect](../../concepts/vm-connection.md) it to {{ backup-name }}, and [link](../policy-vm/attach-and-detach-vm.md#attach-vm) it to at least one [backup policy](../../concepts/policy.md). Any backup can only be created within policies.

VM backups in {{ backup-name }} are automatically created on the schedule specified in the respective policy.

To create a non-scheduled VM backup:

{% list tabs group=instructions %}

- Management console {#console}

  1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select a folder to create a backup in.
  1. In the list of services, select **{{ compute-name }}**.
  1. Select the VM with the `Running` [status](../../../compute/concepts/vm-statuses.md#list-of-statuses) that you want to back up.
  1. Go to the **Backups** tab.
  1. Click **Create backup**.
  1. In the window that opens, select the backup policy to create the VM backup under and click **Create**.

  The VM backup creation will start.

- CLI {#cli}

  {% include [cli-install](../../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

  {% include [default-catalogue](../../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

  1. View the description of the CLI command to create a backup:

      ```bash
      yc backup policy execute --help
      ```

  1. Get the ID of the backup policy to use for creating the backup:

      {% include [get-backup-id](../../../_includes/backup/operations/get-policy-id.md) %}

  1. Get the ID of the VM you want to back up:

      {% include [get-vm-id](../../../_includes/backup/operations/get-vm-id.md) %}

  1. Create a backup:

      ```bash
      yc backup policy execute \
        --id <policy_ID> \
        --instance-id <VM_ID>
      ```

      Where:

      * `--id`: ID of the backup policy to use for creating the backup.
      * `--instance-id`: ID of the VM you want to back up.

      Result:

      ```bash
      id: abcsdngawmqv********
      description: execute policy
      created_at: "2024-08-19T09:38:06.015732Z"
      created_by: def9k8luj4qf********
      modified_at: "2024-08-19T09:38:06.015732Z"
      metadata:

        policy_id: hij86k3tu3pu********
        compute_instance_id: klmc87d7q49r********
      ```
