# Leaving an organization

If you are not a federated user, you can leave an organization on your own. To do this:

1. Go to [{{ org-full-name }}]({{link-org-main}}).

1. If you belong to multiple organizations, click the user profile image in the bottom left corner and select the appropriate organization.

1. In the panel on the left, select the [{{ ui-key.yacloud_org.pages.users }}]({{ link-org-users }}) section. ![icon-users](../../_assets/console-icons/person.svg).

1. In the employee line, click ![icon-context-menu](../../_assets/console-icons/ellipsis.svg) and select **{{ ui-key.yacloud_org.entity.user.action.remove }}**.

Please note: You will lose access to all clouds and other resources of the organization. To avoid this, you can [move](../../resource-manager/operations/cloud/change-organization.md) the cloud to another organization. To do this, you need the `{{ roles-cloud-owner }}` [role](../security/index.md#organization-manager-organizations-owner) for the cloud being transferred and the `{{ roles-organization-owner }}` [role](../../resource-manager/security/index.md#resource-manager-clouds-owner) for the organization to transfer the cloud to.

To disable access to the clouds of the organization you are not going to leave, contact the appropriate cloud administrator.
