# Service roles for managing connections using {{ connection-manager-full-name }}

With {{ connection-manager-full-name }} service roles, you can view non-secret connection data and manage connections. You can view secret connection data, such as DB passwords, in [{{ lockbox-full-name }}](../../lockbox/index.yaml). To do this, you will also need the `lockbox.payloadViewer` [role](../../lockbox/security/index.md#lockbox-payloadViewer).
