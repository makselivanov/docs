# {{ sws-full-name }} overview

{{ sws-full-name }} is a service for protection against DDoS attacks and bots at application level L7 of the [OSI model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model).

You can connect the service to [{{ alb-full-name }}](../../application-load-balancer/) [virtual hosts](../../application-load-balancer/concepts/http-router.md#virtual-host).

In a nutshell, the service checks the HTTP requests sent to the protected resource via the virtual host of the L7 load balancer against the [rules](rules.md) configured in the [security profile](profiles.md). Depending on the results of the check, the requests are routed to the virtual host, blocked, or sent to [{{ captcha-full-name }}](../../smartcaptcha/) for additional verification.
