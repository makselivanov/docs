The `resource-manager.clouds.owner` role enables running any operations within the [cloud](../../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#cloud) and its child [resources](../../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md), as well as viewing the list of [billing accounts](../../../billing/concepts/billing-account.md) and linking the cloud to them. This role must be assigned for a billing account. By default, the users with this role get [notifications](../../../resource-manager/concepts/notify.md) on what happens to the cloud and its folders.

This role also includes the `admin` and `resource-manager.clouds.member` permissions.

The role can only be assigned for a cloud.
