The `marketplace.publishers.member` role provides the [partner profile](../../../marketplace/quickstart.md#registration) member access; however, it does not grant any access to the profile resources. To grant access to [products](../../../marketplace/concepts/product.md) or partner profile reports, you also need to assign the `marketplace.publishers.viewer`, `marketplace.publishers.editor`, `marketplace.publishers.admin`, or `marketplace.publishers.owner` role to the relevant user.
