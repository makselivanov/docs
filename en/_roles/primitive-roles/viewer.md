The `viewer` role grants the permissions to read the info on any Yandex Cloud [resources](../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md).

This role also includes the `auditor` permissions.

Unlike `auditor`, the `viewer` role provides access to [service](../../overview/concepts/services.md) data in read mode.
