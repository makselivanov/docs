The `admin` role enables assigning any roles, except for `resource-manager.clouds.owner` and `organization-manager.organizations.owner`, and provides permissions to manage any Yandex Cloud [resources](../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md) (except for transferring [organization](../../organization/quickstart.md) ownership and removing an organization).

Prior to assigning the `admin` role for an organization, [cloud](../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#cloud), or [billing account](../../billing/concepts/billing-account.md), make sure to check out the information on protecting [privileged accounts](../../security/standard/all.md#privileged-users).

This role also includes the `editor` permissions.
