The `billing.accounts.owner` role is granted automatically when you create a [billing account](../../../billing/concepts/billing-account.md). The role granted when creating an account cannot be revoked, but it can be [assigned](../../../billing/security/index.md#set-role) to other users and [revoked](../../../billing/security/index.md#delete-role) from them.
