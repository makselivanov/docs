# Storage in {{ mpg-name }}



{{ mpg-name }} allows you to use network and local storage drives for database clusters. Network drives are based on network blocks, which are virtual disks in the {{ yandex-cloud }} infrastructure.Local disks are physically located on the database host servers.

{% include [storage-type-nrd](../../_includes/mdb/mpg/storage-type.md) %}


## Selecting the disk type during cluster creation {#storage-type-selection}

The number of hosts you can create together with a {{ PG }} cluster depends on the selected disk type:

* With local SSDs (`local-ssd`) or non-replicated SSDs (`network-ssd-nonreplicated`), you can create a cluster with three or more hosts.

    This cluster will be fault-tolerant.

    Local SSD storage has an effect on how much a cluster will cost: you pay for it even if it is stopped. For more information, see [Pricing policy](../pricing.md).

* With network HDD (`network-hdd`) or network SSD (`network-ssd`) storage, you can add any number of hosts within the current quota.

For more information about limits on the number of hosts per cluster, see [Quotas and limits](./limits.md).



## Disk space management {#manage-storage-space}

When the storage is more than 97% full, the host automatically switches to read-only mode. All DBs get the `DEFAULT_TRANSACTION_READ_ONLY = TRUE` setting through the `ALTER DATABASE` query.

In this mode, the `INSERT`, `DELETE`, or `UPDATE` queries result in an error.


You can monitor storage utilization on cluster hosts [by setting up alerts in {{ monitoring-full-name }}](../operations/storage-space.md#set-alert):


### Recovering a cluster from read-only mode {#read-only-solutions}

Use one of these methods:

* [Increase the storage capacity](../operations/storage-space.md#change-disk-size) so that it exceeds the threshold value. {{ mpg-short-name }} Will then disable read-only mode automatically.

* [Disable read-only mode manually](../operations/storage-space.md#read-only-solutions) and free up storage space by deleting some data.

    {% note alert %}

    When doing so, make sure the amount of free disk space never reaches zero. Otherwise, since the fail-safe mechanism is disabled, {{ PG }} will crash and the cluster will stop operating.

    {% endnote %}

### Automatic increase of storage size {#auto-rescale}

Automatic storage size increase prevents situations where the disk runs out of free space and hosts switch to read-only mode. The storage size increases upon reaching the specified trigger threshold: a percentage of the total capacity. There are two thresholds:

* Scheduled increase threshold. When reached, the storage size increases during the next [maintenance window](maintenance.md#maintenance-window).
* Immediate increase threshold. When reached, the storage size increases immediately.

You can use either one or both of these thresholds. If both thresholds are set, make sure the immediate increase threshold is higher than the scheduled one.

{% include [storage-resize-steps](../../_includes/mdb/mpg/storage-resize-steps.md) %}

You can configure automatic increase of the storage size when [creating](../operations/cluster-create.md) or [updating a cluster](../operations/storage-space.md#disk-size-autoscale). If the scheduled increase threshold is set, configure the maintenance window schedule.
