## May 2024 {#may-2024}

* Users with the `mdb_admin` role can now use the `pg_stat_reset_single_table_counters()` and `pg_stat_reset_single_function_counters()` functions.

## March 2024 {#mar-2024}

* Added the ability to configure incremental [auto increase of cluster storage size](./operations/storage-space.md#disk-size-autoscale). The user can set the disk storage usage threshold and the maximum disk size. Upon reaching the threshold, the disk size will automatically increase in fixed increments up to its maximum. {{ tag-con }} {{ tag-cli }} {{ tag-api }}
* Added the ability to upgrade {{ PG }} for 1C to version 13, 14, and 15.
* Installed the updates from [16.2, 15.6, 14.11, 13.14, and 12.18](https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/postgresql-162-156-1411-1314-and-1218-released-2807/).
* Expanded the permissions for users with the `mdb_admin` [role](./concepts/roles.md#mdb-admin). Now they can:
  
  * Grant additional users permissions to use the `pg_cron` extension.
  * Reset statistics using the `pg_stat_reset_shared()` function.
  * Terminate the `autovacuum` sessions.

* Now you can audit {{ mpg-name }} cluster connection events and `pgaudit` events in {{ at-full-name }}.

## Q4 2023 {#q4-2023}

* Added support for {{ PG }} version 16.

    Key changes in the new version:

    * Added the `pg_stat_io` view for input/output monitoring.
    * Added parallel execution of a full and a right hash connection.
    * Improved the performance of the *vacuum freeze* operation.
    * Added the logical replication setting from a replica.
    * New version 16 clusters use ICU locales instead of libc.

    To learn how to update a cluster, see [{#T}](operations/cluster-version-update.md).

    For more information about the updates in {{ PG }} version 16, see the [{{ PG }} documentation]({{ pg.docs.org }}/release/16.0/).

## Q3 2023 {#q3-2023}

Starting August 14, you can no longer create new clusters of this version, and the existing clusters were automatically updated on September 12 as part of the maintenance window.

## Q2 2023 {#q2-2023}

* You can now export raw data on performance diagnostics using the [PerformanceDiagnosticsService/ListRawSessionStates](api-ref/grpc/perf_diag_service.md#ListRawSessionStates) and [PerformanceDiagnosticsService/ListRawStatements](api-ref/grpc/perf_diag_service.md#ListRawStatements) gRPC API calls.
* Added the `Session duration timeout` setting that controls the lifetime of the longest active session or transaction. The default value is 12 hours.

    * Added support for the `SQL MERGE` command that enables performing the `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` action depending on the conditions.
    * You can now specify column lists and row filter conditions. This allows selective publication of table contents within logical replication publications.
    * You can now specify [ICU]({{ pg.docs.org }}/15/locale.html#id-1.6.11.3.7) for a database by default.
    * Performance improvements, in particular, for in-memory and on-disk sorting.
