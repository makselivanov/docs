# Access management in {{ yq-name }}

{{ yq-name }} uses [roles](../../iam/concepts/access-control/roles.md) to manage access rights.

{{ yandex-cloud }} users can only perform operations on resources that are allowed by the roles assigned to them. As long as a user has no roles assigned, almost all operations are forbidden.

To allow access to {{ yq-full-name }} resources, assign the required roles from the list below to a Yandex account, [service account](../../iam/concepts/users/service-accounts.md), [federated users](../../iam/concepts/federations.md), [user group](../../organization/operations/manage-groups.md), [system group](../../iam/concepts/access-control/system-group.md), or [public group](../../iam/concepts/access-control/public-group.md). Currently, a role can only be assigned for a parent resource (folder or cloud). Roles are inherited by nested resources.

Roles for a resource can be assigned by users who have the `yq.admin` role or one of the following roles for that resource:

{% include [roles-list](../../_includes/iam/roles-list.md) %}

{% note info %}

For more information about role inheritance, see [{#T}](../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#access-rights-inheritance) in the {{ resmgr-full-name }} documentation.

## Assigning roles {#grant-roles}

To assign a user a role:

{% include [grant-role-console](../../_includes/grant-role-console.md) %}

## Which roles exist in the service {#roles-list}

You can manage access to {{ yq-name }} objects using both service and primitive roles. The chart below shows which roles are available in the service and how they inherit each other's permissions. For example, the `editor` role includes all `viewer` role permissions. You can find the description of each role under the chart.
