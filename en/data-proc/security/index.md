# Access management in {{ dataproc-name }}

{{ yandex-cloud }} users can only perform operations on resources that are allowed by the roles assigned to them. If a user does not have any roles assigned, almost all operations are forbidden.

To enable access to {{ dataproc-name }} resources (clusters and subclusters), assign the required roles from the list below to a Yandex account, [service account](../../iam/concepts/users/service-accounts.md), [federated users](../../iam/concepts/federations.md), [user group](../../organization/operations/manage-groups.md), [system group](../../iam/concepts/access-control/system-group.md), or [public group](../../iam/concepts/access-control/public-group.md). Currently, a role can only be assigned for a parent resource (folder or cloud). Roles are inherited by nested resources.

Roles for a resource can be assigned by users who have the `mdb.admin`, `dataproc.admin`, or one of the following roles for that resource:

{% include [roles-list](../../_includes/iam/roles-list.md) %}

{% note info %}

For more information about role inheritance, see [{#T}](../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#access-rights-inheritance) in the {{ resmgr-full-name }} documentation.
