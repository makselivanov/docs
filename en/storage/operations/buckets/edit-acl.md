# Editing a bucket's ACL

{% include [full-overview](../../../_includes/storage/security/full-overview.md) %}

{% note info %}

If an [ACL](../../concepts/acl.md) has already been set for a [bucket](../../concepts/bucket.md), it will be completely overwritten once you apply the changes.

{% endnote %}

{% list tabs group=instructions %}

- Management console {#console}

  1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select the appropriate folder.
  1. Select **{{ objstorage-name }}**.
  1. To edit an ACL, click ![image](../../../_assets/console-icons/ellipsis.svg) to the right of the bucket name and select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.storage.buckets.button_permissions }}**.

     You can also click the bucket name and then click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.storage.buckets.button_permissions }}** on the page that opens.

  1. In the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.component.acl-dialog.label_title }}** window that opens, grant or revoke the appropriate permissions.

      {% endnote %}

- {{ yandex-cloud }} CLI {#cli}

  {% include [cli-install](../../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

  {% include [default-catalogue](../../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

  Before configuring an ACL, view a description of the CLI command to edit a bucket:

  ```bash
  yc storage bucket update --help
  ```

  To view a bucket's current ACL, run this command:

  ```bash
  yc storage bucket get <bucket_name> --with-acl
  ```

  You can apply a [predefined ACL](../../concepts/acl.md#predefined-acls) to a bucket or configure permissions for individual users, [service accounts](../../../iam/concepts/users/service-accounts.md), [user groups](../../../organization/concepts/groups.md) and [public groups](../../concepts/acl.md#public-groups) (e.g., a group of all internet users or a group of all authenticated {{ yandex-cloud }} users). These settings are not compatible: a bucket should have either a predefined ACL or a set of individual permissions.


  Predefined ACL

  : Run this command:

    ```bash
    yc storage bucket update --name <bucket_name> --acl <predefined_ACL>
    ```

    Where:
    * `--name`: Bucket name.
    * `--acl`: Predefined ACL. For the list of values, see [{#T}](../../concepts/acl.md#predefined-acls).

    Result:

    ```text
    name: my-bucket
    folder_id: csgeoelk7fl1********
    default_storage_class: STANDARD
    versioning: VERSIONING_DISABLED
    max_size: "1073741824"
    acl:
      grants:
        - permission: PERMISSION_READ
          grant_type: GRANT_TYPE_ALL_USERS
    created_at: "2022-12-14T19:10:05.957940Z"
    ```

  Setting up individual permissions

  : 1. To grant ACL permissions to a {{ yandex-cloud }} user, service account, or user group, get their ID:

        
        * [User](../../../iam/operations/users/get.md).
        * [Service account](../../../iam/operations/sa/get-id.md).
        * User group: Navigate to the [**{{ ui-key.yacloud_org.pages.groups }}**]({{ link-org-main }}groups) tab in the {{ org-name }} interface.


    1. Run this command:

       ```bash
       yc storage bucket update --name <bucket_name> \
         --grants grant-type=<permission_grantee_type>,grantee-id=<grantee_ID>,permission=<permission_type>
       ```

       Where:
       * `grant-type`: Permission grantee type. The possible values are as follows:
         * `grant-type-account`: User, [service account](../../../iam/concepts/users/service-accounts.md), or [user group](../../../organization/concepts/groups.md).
         * `grant-type-all-authenticated-users`: [Public group](../../concepts/acl.md#public-groups) that includes all authenticated {{ yandex-cloud }} users.
         * `grant-type-all-users`: Public group that includes all internet users.
       * `grantee-id`: ID of the user, service account, or user group you need to grant a permission to. Specify only if `grant-type=grant-type-account`.
       * `permission`: ACL permission type. The possible values are as follows:
         * `permission-read`: Permission to access the list of objects in the bucket, read various bucket settings (lifecycle, CORS, or static hosting), and read all objects in the bucket.
         * `permission-write`: Permission to write, overwrite, and delete objects in the bucket. Can only be used together with `permission-read`.
         * `permission-full-control`: Full access to the bucket and the objects in it.

         For more information about permissions, see [{#T}](../../concepts/acl.md#permissions-types).

       To configure multiple permissions, specify the `--grants` parameter multiple times. For example, to grant a write permission for a bucket, run the following command:

       ```bash
       yc storage bucket update --name <bucket_name> \
         --grants grant-type=<permission_grantee_type>,grantee-id=<grantee_ID>,permission=permission-read \
         --grants grant-type=<permission_grantee_type>,grantee-id=<grantee_ID>,permission=permission-write
       ```

- AWS CLI {#aws-cli}

  If you do not have the AWS CLI yet, [install and configure it](../../tools/aws-cli.md).

  {% note info %}

  To manage bucket ACLs, assign the `storage.admin` [role](../../security/index.md#storage-admin) to the service account through which the AWS CLI works.

  {% endnote %}


  View the bucket's current ACL:

  ```bash
  aws s3api get-bucket-acl \
    --endpoint https://{{ s3-storage-host }} \
    --bucket <bucket_name>
  ```

  Where:
  * `--bucket`: Bucket name.
  * `--endpoint`: {{ objstorage-name }} endpoint.

  You can apply a [predefined ACL](../../concepts/acl.md#predefined-acls) to a bucket or configure permissions for individual users, [service accounts](../../../iam/concepts/users/service-accounts.md), [user groups](../../../organization/concepts/groups.md) and [public groups](../../concepts/acl.md#public-groups) (e.g., a group of all internet users or a group of all authenticated {{ yandex-cloud }} users). These settings are not compatible: a bucket should have either a predefined ACL or a set of individual permissions.

  Predefined ACL

  : Run this command:

    ```bash
      aws s3api put-bucket-acl \
        --endpoint https://{{ s3-storage-host }} \
        --bucket <bucket_name> \
        --acl <predefined_ACL>
    ```

    Where:

    * `--endpoint`: {{ objstorage-name }} endpoint.
    * `--bucket`: Bucket name.
    * `--acl`: Predefined ACL. For the list of values, see [{#T}](../../concepts/acl.md#predefined-acls).
  
  Setting up individual permissions

  : 1. To grant ACL permissions to a {{ yandex-cloud }} user, service account, or user group, get their ID:

        
        * [User](../../../iam/operations/users/get.md).
        * [Service account](../../../iam/operations/sa/get-id.md).
        * User group: Navigate to the [**{{ ui-key.yacloud_org.pages.groups }}**]({{ link-org-main }}groups) tab in the {{ org-name }} interface.


    1. Run this command:

        ```bash
        aws s3api put-bucket-acl \
          --endpoint https://{{ s3-storage-host }} \
          --bucket <bucket_name> \
          <permission_type> <permission_grantee>
        ```

        Where:
        * `--bucket`: Bucket name.
        * `--endpoint`: {{ objstorage-name }} endpoint.
        * Possible types of ACL permissions:
          * `--grant-read`: Permission to access the list of objects in the bucket, read various bucket settings (lifecycle, CORS, static hosting), and read all objects in the bucket.
          * `--grant-write`: Permission to write, overwrite, and delete objects in the bucket. Can only be used together with `--grant-read`.
          * `--grant-full-control`: Full access to the bucket and the objects in it.

          For more information about permissions, see [{#T}](../../concepts/acl.md#permissions-types).

        * The possible permission grantees are:
          * `id=<grantee_ID>`: ID of the user, service account, or user group you need to grant a permission to.
          * `uri=http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AuthenticatedUsers`: [Public group](../../concepts/acl.md#public-groups) that includes all authenticated {{ yandex-cloud }} users.
          * `uri=http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AllUsers`: Public group that includes all internet users.

        To configure multiple permissions, specify the settings, permission type, and permission grantee multiple times. For example, to grant a write permission for a bucket, run the following command:

        ```bash
        aws s3api put-bucket-acl \
          --endpoint https://storage.yandexcloud.net \
          --bucket <bucket_name> \
          --grant-read id=<grantee_ID> \
          --grant-write id=<grantee_ID>
        ```

- {{ TF }} {#tf}

  {% include [terraform-role](../../../_includes/storage/terraform-role.md) %}


  {% include [terraform-install](../../../_includes/terraform-install.md) %}

  Before you start, retrieve the [static access keys](../../../iam/operations/sa/create-access-key.md): a secret key and a key ID used for authentication in {{ objstorage-short-name }}.

  1. In the configuration file, describe the parameters of the resources you want to create:

     ```hcl
     resource "yandex_storage_bucket" "test" {
       access_key = "<static_key_ID>"
       secret_key = "<secret_key>"
       bucket = "<bucket_name>"
       grant {
         id          = "<user_ID>"
         type        = "CanonicalUser"
         permissions = ["FULL_CONTROL"]
       }

       grant {
         type        = "Group"
         permissions = ["READ", "WRITE"]
         uri         = "http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AllUsers"
       }
     }
     ```

     Where:

     * `access_key`: Static access key ID.
     * `secret_key`: Private access key value.
     * `bucket`: Bucket name. This is a required parameter.
     * `grant`: [ACL](../../concepts/acl.md) settings. This is an optional parameter. To manage this parameter, the service account for which the static access keys were obtained must have the `storage.admin` [role](../../security/index.md#roles-list) for a bucket or folder.
       * `type`: Permission grantee type. The possible values are as follows:
         * `CanonicalUser`: For a user, [service account](../../../iam/concepts/users/service-accounts.md), or [user group](../../../organization/concepts/groups.md).
         * `Group`: For a [public group](../../concepts/acl.md#public-groups).
       * `permissions`: Type of ACL [permissions](../../concepts/acl.md#permissions-types). The possible values are:
         * `READ`: Permission to access the list of objects in the bucket, read various bucket settings (lifecycle, CORS, static hosting), and read all objects in the bucket.
         * `WRITE`: Permission to write, overwrite, and delete objects in the bucket. Can only be used together with `READ`, e.g., `permissions = ["READ", "WRITE"]`.
         * `FULL_CONTROL`: Full access to the bucket and the objects in it.

         For more information about permissions, see [{#T}](../../concepts/acl.md#permissions-types).

       * `id`: ID of the user, service account, or user group. Used with the `CanonicalUser` type of permission grantee.

         
         You can get the IDs in any of the following ways:
         * [User](../../../iam/operations/users/get.md).
         * [Service account](../../../iam/operations/sa/get-id.md).
         * User group: Navigate to the [**{{ ui-key.yacloud_org.pages.groups }}**]({{ link-org-main }}groups) tab in the {{ org-name }} interface.


       * `uri`: Public group ID. Used with the `Group` type of permission grantee. The possible values are as follows:
         * `http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AllUsers`: All internet users.
         * `http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AuthenticatedUsers`: All authenticated {{ yandex-cloud }} users.

     Instead of `grant`, you can specify `acl`, i.e., the [predefined ACL](../../../storage/concepts/acl.md#predefined-acls) of the bucket. The default value is `private`: {{ yandex-cloud }} users get permissions based on their roles in {{ iam-short-name }}.

     For more information about the resources that you can create with {{ TF }}, see the [provider documentation]({{ tf-provider-link }}/).

  1. Make sure the configuration files are correct.

     1. In the command line, go to the folder where you created the configuration file.
     1. Run a check using this command:

        ```bash
        terraform plan
        ```

     If the configuration is described correctly, the terminal will display a list of created resources and their parameters. If the configuration contains any errors, {{ TF }} will point them out.

  1. Deploy cloud resources.

     1. If the configuration does not contain any errors, run this command:

        ```bash
        terraform apply
        ```

     1. Confirm that you want to create the resources.

     All the resources you need will then be created in the specified folder. You can check the new resources and their configuration using the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}).

- API {#api}

  To edit a bucket's ACL, use the [update](../../api-ref/Bucket/update.md) REST API method for the [Bucket](../../api-ref/Bucket/index.md) resource, the [BucketService/Update](../../api-ref/grpc/bucket_service.md#Update) gRPC API call, or the [bucketPutAcl](../../s3/api-ref/acl/bucketput.md) S3 API method.
