### Using storage {#rules-storage}

Storage usage is measured in GB per month. The volume of data stored during a month is taken as the month's average based on granulated per-second data. The minimum billing unit is 1 hour of storing 1 MB of data.

### Performing operations with data {#rules-operations}

Data operations are billed according to the following policy:
* The minimum billing unit for PUT, POST, PATCH, LIST, and TRANSITION operations is 10.
* The minimum billing unit for GET, HEAD, and OPTIONS operations is 100.

### Data storage {#prices-storage}

The cost of 1 GB per month is fixed and does not depend on the number of days in the month.




{% include [usd.md](../_pricing/storage/usd-used_space.md) %}


^1^ The daily cost of data storage service is calculated as `Cost_of_1_GB_per_month / number_of_days_in_the_month`. For shorter months, the storage cost per day is higher. For longer months, it is lower.

Here is an example of proportional calculation. Let's assume a user stores 15 GB of data for 11.5 hours during a 30-day month. The total cost of storage can be calculated using the formula:

```text
Storage_price = Price_per_GB_per_month × 15 × 12 / 24 / 30
```

^2^ The first 1 GB of data stored in regular storage per month is free of charge.






{% include [usd-used-space-standard](../_pricing_examples/storage/usd-used-space-standard.md) %}


^3^ The minimum billable storage time of an object in ice storage is 12 months. If you delete an object that was stored for less than 12 months, you will be charged the remaining cost after deletion.
