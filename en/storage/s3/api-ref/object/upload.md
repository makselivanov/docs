# upload method

Uploads an object and its metadata to {{ objstorage-full-name }}.

{% note info %}

{{ objstorage-name }} does not block objects for writing and can accept multiple requests to write to the same object in parallel, but the user can only get the last written object from {{ objstorage-name }} by default. To ensure that the history is saved when objects are overwritten or deleted, enable [versioning](../../../concepts/versioning.md).

{% endnote %}

To make sure an object has been delivered via the network uncorrupted, use the `Content-MD5` header. {{ objstorage-name }} will calculate the `MD5` value for the saved object; if the calculated `MD5` value does not match the value provided in the header, it will return an error. You can also perform this check on the client side by comparing the `ETag` from the {{ objstorage-name }} response with the precalculated `MD5` value.

{% note warning %}

If [default object locks](../../../concepts/object-lock.md#default) are configured in the bucket, the `Content-MD5` header is required.

## Request {#request}

```http
PUT /{bucket}/{key} HTTP/2
```

### Path parameters {#path-parameters}

Parameter | Description
----- | -----
`bucket` | Bucket name.
`key` | Object key. ID for saving the object in {{ objstorage-name }}.


### Headers {#request-headers}

Use the appropriate [common headers](../common-request-headers.md) in your request.

You can also use the headers listed in the table below.


Header | Description
----- | -----
`X-Amz-Meta-*` | User-defined object metadata.<br/><br/>{{ objstorage-name }} converts all headers starting with `X-Amz-Meta-` according to the following rule: `X-Amz-Meta-foo-bar_baz` â†’ `X-Amz-Meta-Foo-Bar_baz`.<br/><br/>The total size of user-defined headers must not exceed 2 KB. The size of user-defined data is determined as the length of the UTF-8 encoded string. The header names and their values are included when calculating the size.
`X-Amz-Storage-Class` | Object [storage class](../../../concepts/storage-class.md).<br/><br/>It may have any of the following values:<ul><li>`STANDARD`: Standard storage.</li><li>`COLD`, `STANDARD_IA`, or `NEARLINE`: Cold storage.</li><li>`ICE` or `GLACIER`: Ice storage.</li></ul>If the header is not specified, the object is stored in the storage defined in the bucket settings.
`X-Amz-Server-Side-Encryption` | Upload object's encrypion algorithm. Possible values: `aws:kms`.
`X-Amz-Server-Side-Encryption-Aws-Kms-Key-Id` | The ID of the [{{ kms-short-name }} key](../../../../kms/concepts/key.md) for encrypting an uploaded object.
`X-Amz-Object-Lock-Mode` | <p>Type of [retention](../../../concepts/object-lock.md) put on the object (if the bucket is [versioned](../../../concepts/versioning.md) and object lock is enabled in it):</p><ul><li>`GOVERNANCE`: Object lock with governance-mode retention.</li><li>`COMPLIANCE`: Object lock with compliance-mode retention.</li></ul><p>For an object version, you can use only retention (`X-Amz-Object-Lock-Mode` and `X-Amz-Object-Lock-Retain-Until-Date` headers), only legal hold (`X-Amz-Object-Lock-Legal-Hold`), or both at the same time. For more information about their combined use, see [{#T}](../../../concepts/object-lock.md#types).</p>
`X-Amz-Object-Lock-Retain-Until-Date` | Date and time of end of retention in any format described in the [HTTP standard](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#name-date-time-formats), e.g., `Mon, 12 Dec 2022 09:00:00 GMT`. Specify it only with the `X-Amz-Object-Lock-Mode` header.
`X-Amz-Object-Lock-Legal-Hold` | <p>Type of [legal hold](../../../concepts/object-lock.md) put on the object (if the bucket is [versioned](../../../concepts/versioning.md) and object lock is enabled in it):</p><ul><li>`ON`: Enabled.</li><li>`OFF`: Disabled.</li></ul><p>For an object version, you can use only retention (`X-Amz-Object-Lock-Mode` and `X-Amz-Object-Lock-Retain-Until-Date` headers), only legal hold (`X-Amz-Object-Lock-Legal-Hold`), or both at the same time. For more information about their combined use, see [{#T}](../../../concepts/object-lock.md#types).</p>


By using the headers listed below, you can set the [ACL](../../../concepts/acl.md) for an object to be uploaded.
