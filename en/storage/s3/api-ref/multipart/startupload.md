### Headers {#request-headers}

Use the appropriate [common headers](../common-request-headers.md) in your request.

You can also use the headers listed in the table below.

Header | Description
----- | -----
`X-Amz-Meta-*` | User-defined object metadata.<br/><br/>{{ objstorage-name }} converts all headers starting with `X-Amz-Meta-` according to the following rule: `X-Amz-Meta-foo-bar_baz` â†’ `X-Amz-Meta-Foo-Bar_baz`.<br/><br/>The total size of user-defined headers must not exceed 2 KB. The size of user-defined data is determined as the length of the UTF-8 encoded string. The header names and their values are included when calculating the size.
`X-Amz-Storage-Class` | Object [storage class](../../../concepts/storage-class.md).<br/><br/>It may have any of the following values:<ul><li>`STANDARD`: Standard storage.</li><li>`COLD`, `STANDARD_IA`, or `NEARLINE`: Cold storage.</li><li>`ICE` or `GLACIER`: Ice storage.</li></ul>If the header is not specified, the object is stored in the storage defined in the bucket settings.
`X-Amz-Object-Lock-Mode` | <p>Type of [retention](../../../concepts/object-lock.md) put on the object (if the bucket is [versioned](../../../concepts/versioning.md) and object lock is enabled in it):</p><ul><li>`GOVERNANCE`: Object lock with governance-mode retention.</li><li>`COMPLIANCE`: Object lock with compliance-mode retention.</li></ul><p>For an object version, you can use only retention (`X-Amz-Object-Lock-Mode` and `X-Amz-Object-Lock-Retain-Until-Date` headers), only legal hold (`X-Amz-Object-Lock-Legal-Hold`), or both at the same time. For more information about their combined use, see [{#T}](../../../concepts/object-lock.md#types).</p>
`X-Amz-Object-Lock-Retain-Until-Date` | Date and time of end of retention in any format described in the [HTTP standard](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#name-date-time-formats), e.g., `Mon, 12 Dec 2022 09:00:00 GMT`. Specify it only with the `X-Amz-Object-Lock-Mode` header.
`X-Amz-Object-Lock-Legal-Hold` | <p>Type of [legal hold](../../../concepts/object-lock.md) put on the object (if the bucket is [versioned](../../../concepts/versioning.md) and object lock is enabled in it):</p><ul><li>`ON`: Enabled.</li><li>`OFF`: Disabled.</li></ul><p>For an object version, you can use only retention (`X-Amz-Object-Lock-Mode` and `X-Amz-Object-Lock-Retain-Until-Date` headers), only legal hold (`X-Amz-Object-Lock-Legal-Hold`), or both at the same time. For more information about their combined use, see [{#T}](../../../concepts/object-lock.md#types).</p>

By using the headers listed below, you can set the [ACL](../../../concepts/acl.md) for an object to be uploaded.
