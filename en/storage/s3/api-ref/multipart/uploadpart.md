# uploadPart method

Saves a part of an object.

Users number object parts themselves and transmit the numbers to {{ objstorage-name }}. The number uniquely identifies the part and determines its position in the general sequence. The number is an integer in the range from 1 to 10,000 inclusive.

If multiple parts with the same number are uploaded, {{ objstorage-name }} saves the last one received.

The size of each part, except the last one, should be at least 5 MB.

For more information, see [{#T}](../multipart.md).
