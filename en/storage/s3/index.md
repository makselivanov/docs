# How to use the S3 API

## Getting started {#before-you-start}

To use the API:

{% include [aws-tools-prepare](../../_includes/aws-tools/aws-tools-prepare.md) %}

To access the HTTP API directly, you need static key authentication, which is supported by the tools listed in [{#T}](../tools/index.md).


{% include [store-aws-key-in-lockbox](../../_includes/storage/store-aws-key-in-lockbox.md) %}


For a list of supported Amazon S3 HTTP API methods, see the [API reference](api-ref/index.md).

## General API request format {#common-request-form}

{% note info %}

To access the S3 API from {{ objstorage-name }}, we recommend the [AWS CLI](../tools/aws-cli.md) or [AWS SDK](../tools/sdk/index.md) suitable for your development environment.

{% endnote %}

General {{ objstorage-name }} API request format:

```
{GET|HEAD|PUT|DELETE} /<bucket_name>/<object_key> HTTP/2
Host: {{ s3-storage-host }}
Content-Length: length
Date: date
Authorization: authorization string (AWS Signature Version 4)

Request_body
```

The request contains an HTTP method, bucket name, and [object key](../concepts/object.md).

The bucket name can be specified as part of the host name. In this case, the request will look like this:

```
{GET|HEAD|PUT|DELETE} /<object_key>} HTTP/2
Host: <bucket_name>.{{ s3-storage-host }}
...
```

The set of headers depends on the specific request and is described in the documentation for the corresponding request.

When using the API directly (without an SDK or apps), you need to generate the `Authorization` header yourself for signing requests. Find out how to do this in the Amazon S3 documentation: [Authenticating Requests (AWS Signature Version 4)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.html).

{% include [s3api-debug-and-curl](../../_includes/storage/s3api-debug-and-curl.md) %}

### Request URL {#request-url}

URLs can take one of the following forms:

* `http(s)://{{ s3-storage-host }}/<bucket_name>/<object_key>?<query_parameters>`
* `http(s)://<bucket_name>.{{ s3-storage-host }}/<object_key>?<query_parameters>`

{% note info %}

For buckets with periods in their names, e.g., `example.ru`, HTTPS is available only with a URL in `https://{{ s3-storage-host }}/<bucket_name>/<object_key>?<query_parameters>` format. For more information, see [Accessing a bucket over HTTPS](../concepts/bucket.md#bucket-https).

{% endnote %}

The URL contains the bucket name, object key, and query parameters. See an example of possible query parameters in the [Get object method description](api-ref/object/get.md).

{% include [storage-dotnet-host](../_includes_service/storage-dotnet-host.md) %}

## CORS requests {#cors-requests}

[Cross-domain requests](../concepts/cors.md) are available for all API methods used for object management.

To check permissions, CORS sends the [options](api-ref/object/options.md) preflight request to the resource. {{ objstorage-name }} allows you to skip the preflight request when sending cross-domain requests to resources. In this case, your request's [headers](api-ref/object/options.md#request-headers) must be the same as those of the preflight request.
