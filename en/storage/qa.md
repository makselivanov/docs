# FAQ about {{ objstorage-name }}

#### What is {{ objstorage-full-name }}? {#qa-what-is}

{{ objstorage-full-name }} is a universal scalable solution for data storage. It is equally suited for high-load services requiring reliable and fast access to data and for projects with moderate storage infrastructure requirements.

#### What can I do with {{ objstorage-full-name }}? {#qa-usecases}

With {{ objstorage-name }}, you can:
* Store your project (website or server app) files in {{ objstorage-name }} with public or private access to them. The files can be of any format.
* Store large archive data (up to 5 TB per file) and make them available based on access permissions.
* Enable shared work with data inside a distributed organization.
* Make your data accessible from anywhere in the world where there is internet.

#### How do I get started with {{ objstorage-full-name }}? {#qa-quickstart}

To get started with {{ objstorage-name }}:
1. Sign up for {{ yandex-cloud }}.
1. Create a folder.
   At this step, you can already use {{ objstorage-name }} via the {{ yandex-cloud }} management console. You can create and delete buckets, as well as upload objects to and download them from buckets.
1. Get static keys to use the {{ objstorage-name }} HTTP API or ready-made SDKs and apps.

For more detailed instructions, see [{#T}](quickstart.md) and [{#T}](s3/index.md).

#### What data formats can I store? {#qa-data-types}

You can store data in any format. {{ objstorage-full-name }} saves data in its original form without any modification.

#### How can I leave feedback on {{ objstorage-full-name }}? {#qa-feedback}



Use the feedback form in the [support center]({{ link-console-support }}).



#### How do I contact technical support? {qa-support-channels}



You can contact technical support from the management console in the [Support]({{ link-console-support }}) section.



#### How much data can I store? {#qa-storage-volume}

See [{#T}](concepts/limits.md).

#### How can I delete multiple objects at a time? {#qa-delete-multiple-objects}

You can delete multiple objects via the {{ yandex-cloud }} management console or the API using the [deleteMultipleObjects](s3/api-ref/object/deletemultipleobjects.md) method.


#### A service account cannot access a bucket, why is that? {#sa-bucket-access}


Make sure the service account is assigned the [role](./security/#roles-list) that allows accessing the bucket.


If [encryption](./concepts/encryption.md) is enabled for the bucket, assign the service account the `kms.keys.encrypterDecrypter` [role](../kms/security/#service) for the [{{ kms-short-name }} key](../kms/concepts/key.md) used to encrypt the bucket. You can do this, for example, using the following CLI command:

```bash
yc kms symmetric-key add-access-binding \
  --id <key_ID> \
  --service-account-id <service_account_ID> \
  --role kms.keys.encrypterDecrypter
```

Where:
* `--id`: ID of the {{ kms-short-name }} key.
* `--service-account-id`: Service account ID.



#### What does {{ yandex-cloud }} do with the data I store in {{ objstorage-full-name }}? {#qa-data-use-by-platform}

The data is saved in the form in which it was transmitted by the user.



#### Does Yandex use {{ objstorage-name }} to store its own data? {#qa-usage-by-yandex}

Yes. {{ objstorage-name }} is used in the Yandex infrastructure. A number of Yandex services store their websites' static data in {{ objstorage-name }}.



#### Which data consistency model does {{ objstorage-full-name }} use? {#qa-consistency}

For overwritable (PUT) and removable (DELETE) objects, the strong consistency model is used.

#### What AWS S3 features are supported in {{ objstorage-full-name }}? {#qa-s3-support}

{{ objstorage-name }} supports:
* Authorization using static tokens.
* Some HTTP API methods. For a full list of supported methods, see the [API reference](s3/api-ref/index.md).



#### Where is my data stored? {#qa-where}

Data is stored in several geographically distributed data centers located in Russia. For more information, see [{#T}](../overview/concepts/geo-scope.md).



#### How is my data protected in {{ objstorage-full-name }}? {#qa-data-security}

Physical media are located in {{ yandex-cloud }} data centers, which are high-security facilities.

Data is stored in an encrypted format and none of those who have access to the physical media can read the data.

By default, the storage is accessed via HTTPS.

#### How do you guarantee the performance of {{ objstorage-full-name }}? {#qa-timings}

{{ objstorage-name }} has internal SLAs and SLOs that guarantee a specific speed of sending data to the customer, which, among other things, depend on the storage class.

The {{ objstorage-name }} response time depends on multiple factors:
* Client-side performance (network speed, CPU load, or disk subsystem load).
* Speed of trunk connections, connections between data centers, or client-server connections.
* Performance of {{ objstorage-name }} itself.

This is why we cannot specify a particular response time value. However, we do not consider a sharp increase in response time or a marked decrease in the speed of sending data to be the norm, and keep working to improve the technical characteristics of {{ objstorage-name }}.

#### How do I add my own domain to a {{ objstorage-name }} bucket? {#domain-bucket}

To add your [domain](operations/hosting/own-domain.md) to a [bucket](concepts/bucket.md):

1. [Create](operations/buckets/create.md) a bucket with the same name as your domain.

1. {% include [setup-bucket.md](../_includes/storage/setup-bucket.md) %}

1. On your DNS server, [create](operations/hosting/own-domain.md#domain-support) a CNAME record to link your domain to the bucket.

1. {% include [create-cert.md](../_includes/storage/create-cert.md) %}

1. {% include [add-cert.md](../_includes/storage/add-cert.md) %}

{% include [objects-access.md](../_includes/storage/objects-access.md) %}


#### Why did I lose access to the bucket after creating/updating an access policy? {#qa-lost-access}

1. [Access policies](concepts/policy.md) treat objects within a bucket and the bucket itself as different resources. For an access policy rule to apply both to the bucket and the objects in it, specify them as separate resources, e.g., `samplebucket` and `samplebucket/*`.

1. If a bucket policy with no rules is applied to the bucket, access is denied to all users. To disable request verification for a bucket policy, [delete](operations/buckets/policy.md#delete-policy) it.

#### How do I get access to {{ objstorage-name }} from a {{ vpc-name }} cloud network? {#qa-from-vpc}

For resources hosted in a {{ vpc-short-name }} cloud network and having no public IP addresses or no access to the internet, you can [set up a connection](../tutorials/routing/storage-vpc-access.md) to {{ objstorage-name }} via an [API endpoint](../api-design-guide/concepts/endpoints.md). FQDN of the endpoint will be translated to a public IP using DNS.
