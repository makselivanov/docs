# {{ data-transfer-name }} release notes: May 2024

## New features {#new-features}

1. You can no longer create {{ mes-short-name }} endpoints as the service support in {{ yandex-cloud }} is [discontinued](../../managed-elasticsearch).


## Fixed issues {#problems-solved}

1. Extended the feature of `Date` and `DateTime` type mapping for the [{{ ydb-name }} target](../operations/endpoint/target/yandex-database.md). Now you can create a transfer of the required type without any additional conversions.

1. Improved replication from [{{ PG }}](../operations/endpoint/source/postgresql.md) when deleting columns from tables in the source database.
