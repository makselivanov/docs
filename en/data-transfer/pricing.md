{{ data-transfer-name }} cost depends on the amount of computing resources you use and the number of data rows delivered by transfers that are at the [GA](../overview/concepts/launch-stages.md) stage:

Data delivery for transfers that are at the Preview stage is free of charge. For a list of available transfers and their release stages, see [Available transfers](transfer-matrix.md).

## Examples of cost calculation {#price-example}

When doing your cost calculation, remember that one [worker](concepts/index.md#worker) uses 2 vCPUs and 4 GB of RAM by default.
### Single data copying from {{ PG }} to {{ CH }} {#copy}

The number of data rows transferred from {{ PG }} to {{ CH }} during the reporting month is 500,000,000. The copying was performed by one worker (2 vCPUs and 4 GB RAM) and took 24 hours.



CPU cost:

> 24 * 2 * $0.01048 = $0.50304

RAM cost:

> 24 * 4 * $0.0028 = $0.2688

Data transfer cost:

> (500 - 100) * $0.0216 = $8.64

**Total cost**:

> $0.50304 + $0.2688 + $8.64 = $9.41184


### Replicating data from {{ PG }} to {{ PG }} {#replication}

The number of data rows transferred from {{ PG }} to {{ PG }} during the reporting month is 50,000,000. The replication was active throughout the month, and was performed by 6 workers (12 vCPUs and 24 GB RAM).



CPU cost:

> 30 * 24 * 12 * $0.01048 = $90.5472

RAM cost:

> 30 * 24 * 24 * $0.0028 = $48.384

Data transfer cost:

Free of charge, as 50,000,000 rows is less than the free usage quota.

**Total cost**:

> $90.5472 + $48.384 = $138.9312
