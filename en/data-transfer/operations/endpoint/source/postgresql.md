# Transferring data from a {{ PG }} source endpoint

{{ data-transfer-full-name }} enables you to migrate data from a {{ PG }} database and implement various data transfer, processing, and transformation scenarios. To implement a transfer:

1. [Explore possible data transfer scenarios](#scenarios).
1. [Prepare the {{ PG }}](#prepare) database for the transfer.
1. [Set up a source endpoint](#endpoint-settings) in {{ data-transfer-full-name }}.
1. [Set up one of the supported data targets](#supported-targets).
1. [Create](../../transfer.md#create) a transfer and [start](../../transfer.md#activate) it.
1. [Perform the required operations with the database](#db-actions) and [see how the transfer is going](../../monitoring.md).
1. In case of any issues, [use ready-made solutions](#troubleshooting) to resolve them.

## Scenarios for transferring data from {{ PG }} {#scenarios}

1. {% include [migration](../../../../_includes/data-transfer/scenario-captions/migration.md) %}

    * [Migrating a {{ PG }}](../../../tutorials/managed-postgresql.md) cluster.

## Preparing the source database {#prepare}

{% include [prepare db](../../../../_includes/data-transfer/endpoints/sources/pg-prepare.md) %}

## Configuring the {{ PG }} source endpoint {#endpoint-settings}

When [creating](../index.md#create) or [updating](../index.md#update) an endpoint, you can define:

* [{{ mpg-full-name }}](#managed-service) connection or [custom installation](#on-premise) settings, including those based on {{ compute-full-name }} VMs. These are required parameters.
* [Additional parameters](#additional-settings).

Before you get started, check the [Service specifics for {{ PG }} sources and targets](../../../concepts/work-with-endpoints.md#postgresql).

### {{ mpg-name }} cluster {#managed-service}


{% note warning %}

To create or edit an endpoint of a managed database, you need to have the [`{{ roles.mpg.viewer }}` role](../../../../managed-postgresql/security/index.md#mpg-viewer) or the [`viewer` primitive role](../../../../iam/roles-reference.md#viewer) assigned for the folder where this managed database cluster resides.

{% endnote %}

{% list tabs group=instructions %}

        * **{{ ui-key.yc-data-transfer.data-transfer.console.form.postgres.console.form.postgres.PostgresTableFilter.include_tables.title }}**: Only data from the tables listed here will be transferred.

        * **{{ ui-key.yc-data-transfer.data-transfer.console.form.postgres.console.form.postgres.PostgresTableFilter.exclude_tables.title }}**: Data from the listed tables is not transferred.

      The lists include the name of the [schema]({{pg-docs}}/ddl-schemas.html) that describes the DB contents, structure, and integrity constraints, as well as the table name. Both lists support expressions in the following format:

        * `<schema_name>.<table_name>`: Full table name.
        * `<schema_name>.*`: All tables in the specified schema.

      Table names must match this regular expression:

      ```text
      ^"?[-_a-zA-Z0-9.]+"?\\."?[$-_a-zA-Z0-9.*]+"?$
      ```

      Double quotes within a table name are not supported. Outer quotes are only used as delimiters and will be deleted when processing paths.

      {% include [transfer custom types PGSQL](../../../../_includes/data-transfer/custom-types-pgsql.md) %}

    * **{{ ui-key.yc-data-transfer.data-transfer.console.form.postgres.console.form.postgres.PostgresSource.object_transfer_settings.title }}**: If required, select the DB schema elements to transfer when activating or deactivating a transfer.

        * **{{ ui-key.yc-data-transfer.data-transfer.console.form.postgres.console.form.postgres.PostgresSourceAdvancedSettings.slot_byte_lag_limit.title }}**: Maximum size of Write-Ahead Log kept in replication slot. If exceeded, the replication process is stopped and the replication slot is deleted. The default value is 50 GB. This setting does not prevent disk overflow in the source database. You can only use it for {{ PG }} version below 13, and we recommend [monitoring the WAL slot value](../../prepare.md#source-pg) in the source database.
          
            {% note warning %}

            The **{{ ui-key.yc-data-transfer.data-transfer.console.form.postgres.console.form.postgres.PostgresSourceAdvancedSettings.slot_byte_lag_limit.title }}** setting does not guarantee replication slot deletion when its threshold value is reached, particularly if there are issues with the transfer or connectivity between the transfer and the source cluster. For additional tips, see [Preparing the source database](#wal-setup-recommendation).

        The schema name must match this regular expression:

        ```text

        ```

        Double quotes are not supported in schema names.

        * **{{ ui-key.yc-data-transfer.data-transfer.console.form.postgres.console.form.postgres.PostgresSourceAdvancedSettings.snapshot_table_sharding_settings.title }}**: If required, specify detailed settings for parallel copying of tables (if parallel copying parameters are set in the transfer).

#### Settings for transferring a DB schema when enabling and disabling a transfer {#schema-migrations-settings}

{% note info %}

The default settings of the source endpoint allow you to successfully perform a transfer for most databases. Change the settings of the initial and final stages of the transfer only if it is necessary.

{% endnote %}

During a transfer, the database schema is transferred from the source to the target. The transfer is performed in two stages:

1. At the activation stage.

    This step is performed when the transfer is activated before copying or replicating data to create a schema on the target. You can choose which parts of the schema will be migrated. By default, these are: `TABLE`, `VIEW`, `PRIMARY KEY`, `SEQUENCE`, `SEQUENCE OWNED BY`, `RULE`, `TYPE`, `FUNCTION`, and `DEFAULT`.

1. At the deactivation stage.

    This step is performed at the end of the transfer operation when it is deactivated. If the transfer keeps running in replication mode, the final stage of the transfer will be performed only when replication stops. You can choose which parts of the schema will be migrated.

    At the final stage, it is assumed that when the transfer is deactivated, there is no writing load on the source. You can ensure this by switching to <q>read-only</q> mode. At this stage, the database schema on the target is brought to a state where it will be consistent with the schema on the source.

    It's recommended to include resource-intensive operations like index migration in the final stage of migration. Migrating indexes at the beginning of the transfer can slow it down.

To transfer the schema at both the initial and final stages, one uses the [`pg_dump`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgdump.html) utility.

{% note info %}

When editing the settings of an endpoint of the transfer in the {{ dt-status-repl }} status, the table schemas on the target are preserved. In this case, only the table schemas that are missing on the target at the transfer restart will be transferred to the target.

{% endnote %}

Replication cannot guarantee that sequence values are preserved, so we recommend updating the `sequence` on the target.

## Configuring the data target {#supported-targets}

Configure one of the supported data targets:

* [{{ PG }}](../target/postgresql.md)
* [{{ MY }}](../target/mysql.md)
* [{{ CH }}](../target/clickhouse.md)
* [{{ GP }}](../target/greenplum.md)
* [{{ ydb-full-name }}](../target/yandex-database.md)
* [{{ objstorage-full-name }}](../target/object-storage.md)
* [{{ KF }}](../target/kafka.md)
* [{{ DS }}](../target/data-streams.md)
* [{{ ES }}](../target/elasticsearch.md)
* [{{ OS }}](../target/opensearch.md)

For a complete list of supported sources and targets in {{ data-transfer-full-name }}, see [Available Transfers](../../../transfer-matrix.md).

After configuring the data source and target, [create and start the transfer](../../transfer.md#create).
