# Access management in {{ data-transfer-name }}


In this section, you will learn:

* [Which resources you can assign a role for](#resources).
* [Which roles exist in the service](#roles-list).
* [Which roles are required](#required-roles) for particular actions.

To use the service, log in to the management console with a [Yandex account](../../iam/concepts/users/accounts.md#passport) or [federated account](../../iam/concepts/users/accounts.md#saml-federation).

## Roles required {#required-roles}

To use the service, you need the `editor` [role](../../iam/concepts/access-control/roles.md) or higher to the folder that projects are being created in. With the `viewer` role, you can only view the list of projects and the contents of files that were downloaded.

To create or edit an endpoint of a managed database, you need the service or primitive [`viewer` role](../../iam/roles-reference.md#viewer) assigned for the folder hosting a cluster of this managed database.

You can always assign a role offering more permissions than the one specified. For example, assign the `admin` role instead of `editor`.
