# Uploading folder audit logs to {{ objstorage-name }}

Follow this guide to create a new [trail](../concepts/trail.md) that will upload management event audit logs of all resources and, optionally, data event audit logs of selected services of an individual folder to an {{ objstorage-name }} bucket.

{% include [bucket-encryption-tip](../../_includes/audit-trails/bucket-encryption-tip.md) %}

## Prepare the environment {#before-you-begin}

To collect folder audit logs:

1. [Create a new bucket](../../storage/operations/buckets/create.md) with restricted access to upload audit logs to.
1. [Create](../../iam/operations/sa/create.md) a service account.

1. {% include [add-roles-to-sa](../../_includes/audit-trails/add-roles-to-sa.md) %}

1. On the [Access bindings]({{ link-console-access-management }}) page, make sure you have the following roles:
   * `iam.serviceAccounts.user` for the service account.
   * `audit-trails.editor` for the folder to host the trail.
   * `audit-trails.viewer` for the folder from which audit logs will be collected.
   * `kms.editor` for the folder where the bucket encryption key will be created.
   * `storage.viewer` for the bucket or folder.

## Creating a trail {#the-trail-creation}

To create your first trail in {{ at-name }} and start the audit log management process:

{% list tabs group=instructions %}

- Management console {#console}

  1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select the folder to host the trail.
  1. Select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.iam.folder.dashboard.label_audit-trails }}**.
  1. Click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.audit-trails.button_create-trail }}** and specify:

      * **{{ ui-key.yacloud.common.name }}**: Name of the new trail.
      * **{{ ui-key.yacloud.common.description }}**: Trail description (optional).

  1. Under **{{ ui-key.yacloud.audit-trails.label_destination }}**, configure the destination object:

      * **{{ ui-key.yacloud.audit-trails.label_destination }}**: `{{ ui-key.yacloud.audit-trails.label_objectStorage }}`.
      * **{{ ui-key.yacloud.audit-trails.label_bucket }}**: Name of the [bucket](../../storage/operations/buckets/create.md) to which you want to upload audit logs.
      * **{{ ui-key.yacloud.audit-trails.label_object-prefix }}**: Optional parameter used in the [full name](../concepts/format.md#log-file-name) of the audit log file.

      {% include [note-bucket-prefix](../../_includes/audit-trails/note-bucket-prefix.md) %}
      * **{{ ui-key.yacloud.audit-trails.title_kms-key }}**: If the bucket you selected is [encrypted](../../storage/concepts/encryption.md), specify the encryption key.

  1. Under **{{ ui-key.yacloud.audit-trails.label_service-account }}**, select the service account that the trail will use to upload audit log files to the bucket.

  1. Under **{{ ui-key.yacloud.audit-trails.label_path-filter-section }}**, configure the collection of management event audit logs:

      * **{{ ui-key.yacloud.audit-trails.label_collecting-logs }}**: Select `{{ ui-key.yacloud.common.enabled }}`.
      * **{{ ui-key.yacloud.audit-trails.label_resource-type }}**: Select `{{ ui-key.yacloud.audit-trails.label_resource-manager.folder }}`.
      * **{{ ui-key.yacloud.audit-trails.label_resource-manager.folder }}**: Automatically populated field containing the name of the current folder.

  1. {% include [data-plane-on-console](../../_includes/audit-trails/data-plane-on-console.md) %}

  1. Click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.common.create }}**.

- CLI {#cli}

   {% include [cli-install](../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

   {% include [default-catalogue](../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

   1. View the description of the [CLI](../../cli/) command for creating a trail:

      ```bash
      yc audit-trails trail create --help
      ```

   1. Run the command to create a trail to collect [management event](../concepts/format.md) audit logs in the current folder:

      ```bash
      yc audit-trails trail create \
        --name <trail_name> \
        --description "<trail_description>" \
        --service-account-id <service_account_ID> \
        --destination-bucket <bucket_name> \
        --destination-bucket-object-prefix <bucket_prefix> \
        --filter-all-folder-id <folder_ID>
      ```

      Where:

      {% include [trail-create-cli-descs_part1](../../_includes/audit-trails/trail-create-cli-descs-part1.md) %}

      {% include [trail-create-cli-descs_storage](../../_includes/audit-trails/trail-create-cli-descs-storage.md) %}

      {% endcut %}

   1. To create a trail to collect management event and [data event](../concepts/format-data-plane.md) audit logs, use the trail's YAML specification file.

      1. Create a trail configuration file, e.g., `specification.yaml`:

         {% cut "specification.yaml" %}

         {% include [cli-spec-folder-storage](../../_includes/audit-trails/cli-spec-folder-storage.md) %}

         {% endcut %}

         {% cut "Specification description" %}

         {% include [trail-create-clispec-descs-part1](../../_includes/audit-trails/trail-create-clispec-descs-part1.md) %}

         {% include [trail-create-clispec-descs-storage](../../_includes/audit-trails/trail-create-clispec-descs-storage.md) %}

         {% include [trail-create-clispec-descs-part2](../../_includes/audit-trails/trail-create-clispec-descs-part2.md) %}

         {% endcut %}

      1. Run the command, specifying the path to the created trail specification file:

         ```bash
         yc audit-trails trail create --file <specification_file_path>
         ```

         {% cut "Result" %}
