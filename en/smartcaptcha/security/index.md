# Access management in {{ captcha-name }}

In this section, you will learn:

* [Which resources you can assign a role for](#resources).
* [Which roles exist in the service](#roles-list).

{% include [about-access-management](../../_includes/iam/about-access-management.md) %}

Roles for a resource can be assigned by users who have the `smart-captcha.admin` role or one of the following roles for that resource:

{% include [roles-list](../../_includes/iam/roles-list.md) %}

## Which resources you can assign a role for {#resources}

You can assign a role for an [organization](../../organization/), [cloud](../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#cloud), or [folder](../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#folder). Roles assigned for an organization, cloud, or folder also apply to the CAPTCHAs in them.

## Which roles exist in the service {#roles-list}

The list below shows all roles considered when verifying access permissions in {{ captcha-name }}.

### Service roles {#service-roles}

## What roles do I need {#choosing-roles}

The table shows actions and minimum roles required to perform them. You can always assign a role offering more permissions than the one specified in the table. For example, you can assign the `smart-captcha.editor` role instead of the `smart-captcha.viewer` role.

| Viewing CAPTCHA information | `smart-captcha.viewer` |
| Creating a CAPTCHA | `smart-captcha.editor` |
| Editing a CAPTCHA | `smart-captcha.editor` |
