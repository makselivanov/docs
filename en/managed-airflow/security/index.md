# Access management in {{ maf-name }}


In this section, you will learn:

* [Which resources you can assign a role for](#resources).
* [Which roles exist in the service](#roles-list).

{% include [about-access-management](../../_includes/iam/about-access-management.md) %}

Roles for a resource can be assigned by users who have the `managed-airflow.admin` role or one of the following roles for that resource:

{% include [roles-list](../../_includes/iam/roles-list.md) %}

## Which resources you can assign a role for {#resources}

{% include [basic-resources](../../_includes/iam/basic-resources-for-access-control.md) %}

To allow access to {{ maf-name }} resources, assign the user the appropriate roles for the folder, cloud, or organization containing these resources.

## Which roles exist in the service {#roles-list}

### Service roles {#service-roles}

Below is a list of all roles that are used to verify access rights in the service.

#### managed-airflow.auditor {#managed-airflow-auditor}

{% include [managed-airflow.auditor](../../_roles/managed-airflow/auditor.md) %}

#### managed-airflow.viewer {#managed-airflow-viewer}

{% include [managed-airflow.viewer](../../_roles/managed-airflow/viewer.md) %}

#### managed-airflow.user {#managed-airflow-user}

{% include [managed-airflow.user](../../_roles/managed-airflow/user.md) %}

#### managed-airflow.editor {#managed-airflow-editor}

{% include [managed-airflow.editor](../../_roles/managed-airflow/editor.md) %}

#### managed-airflow.admin {#managed-airflow-admin}

{% include [managed-airflow.admin](../../_roles/managed-airflow/admin.md) %}

#### managed-airflow.integrationProvider {#managed-airflow-integrationProvider}

{% include [managed-airflow.integrationProvider](../../_roles/managed-airflow/integrationProvider.md) %}

### Primitive roles {#primitive-roles}

#### {{ roles-viewer }} {#viewer}

The `{{ roles-viewer }}` role enables you to view information about {{ maf-name }} clusters and their runtime logs.

#### {{ roles-editor }} {#editor}

Users with the `{{ roles-editor }}` role can manage any resource, e.g., create clusters and create and delete their subclusters.

This role includes the `{{ roles-viewer }}` role.

#### {{ roles-admin }} {#admin}

Users with the `{{ roles-admin }}` role can manage resource access rights, e.g., allow other users to create {{ maf-name }} clusters and to view information about user rights.

This role includes the `{{ roles-editor }}` role.

## Roles required {#required-roles}

To use the service, you need the [{{ roles.maf.editor }} role](../../iam/concepts/access-control/roles.md) or higher for the folder to house the new cluster. The `{{ roles.maf.viewer }}` role enables you only to view the list of clusters.

To create a {{ maf-name }} cluster, you need the [{{ roles-vpc-user }}](../../vpc/security/index.md#vpc-user) role and the `{{ roles.maf.editor }}` role or higher.

You can always assign a role with more permissions. For instance, you can assign `{{ roles.maf.admin }}` instead of `{{ roles.maf.editor }}`.
