# Free tier


Some {{ yandex-cloud }} services offer special plans where certain amounts of services are provided free of charge. These are selected to enable you to develop and launch a small service, website, or application.

{% note info %}

Free tier applies to billing accounts. If multiple organizations or clouds are linked to a billing account, the tag counts all the resources they consume.

For example, Cloud-1 and Cloud-2 are linked to a billing account. Cloud-1 has consumed 500,000 function calls, and Cloud-2 600,000 function calls a month. For function calls, free tier is 1,000,000. This is our calculation of the number of billable function calls:

> (500,000 + 600,000) - 1,000,000 = 100,000

{% endnote %}
