# Routing

When you create a virtual machine (VM) in {{ yandex-cloud }}, it receives a [set of parameters](../../compute/concepts/network.md) for configuring its network environment from the virtual network. The virtual network transmits the values of these parameters to the VM using DHCP. The required network environment parameters for VMs include:

* [Internal IP addresses](../../compute/concepts/network.md#internal-ip) for each network interface of the VM.
* Subnet mask: Defines the size of the [subnet](./network.md#subnet) the VM network interface connects to.
* [Host name and FQDN of the VM](../../compute/concepts/network.md#hostname).
* Default gateway: The first IP address on the subnet to which the VM network interface is connected. It will receive all outbound traffic from the VM to the outside world.

## VM route table {#rt-vm}

In {{ yandex-cloud }}, VM instances are typically created with a single network interface. When being created, a VM will have a route table with only one route: the one to the default gateway with the `0.0.0.0/0` prefix. For this route (prefix), the gateway is always the **first IP address** on the subnet to which the VM network interface is connected.

Let's assume a VM network interface is connected to a subnet with the `192.168.10.0/24` prefix. When the VM was created, its network interface was assigned the `192.168.10.5` IP address in this subnet. The route table for the VM will appear as follows:

```bash
ip route
default via 192.168.10.1 dev eth0 proto dhcp src 192.168.10.5 metric 100
```

This means that all traffic bound for the virtual network must go through the `192.168.10.1` gateway (`eth0` interface).

Changing the IP address for the default gateway in the VM route table may lead to completely losing the VM connectivity.

{% endnote %}

If using a VM with multiple network interfaces, keep in mind that the virtual network will configure a different default gateway for each network interface. To prevent routing conflicts, leave only one default gateway by using the `ip route del` command to delete the route table entries associated with other gateways.

If you create a VM with multiple network interfaces, the route table within the VM will only allow you to select the network interface for outgoing traffic based on specific destination IP prefixes.

## {{ vpc-short-name }} route tables {#rt-vpc}

VM route tables do not support forwarding traffic directly from one VM within a subnet to another. In all cases, traffic is directed to the virtual network's default gateway.

If you need granular routing at the virtual network level, use {{ vpc-short-name }} route tables. This {{ yandex-cloud }} tool can be useful when processing network traffic on specialized VM instances, such as firewalls, NGFWs, secure gateways, and VPNs.

{{ vpc-short-name }} route tables enable you to manage IPv4 traffic routing for VM instances. {{ vpc-name }} does not currently support IPv6.

{{ vpc-short-name }} route tables are created within [cloud networks](./network.md#network) and can be applied to any [subnet](./network.md#subnet) on the same network. You cannot apply a route table to subnets belonging to a different cloud network.

A {{ vpc-short-name }} route table can include one or multiple entries. Each entry defines a static route within the virtual network.

### Static routes {#static}

Each {{ vpc-short-name }} route table entry must include:

* `Destination prefix`: Prefix of the destination IPv4 route in CIDR notation, e.g., `10.20.30.0/24`.
* `Next hop`: Type of the gateway that will handle outgoing traffic for the specified destination prefix. Allowed values include:
    * `IP address`: IP address of the destination gateway, e.g., the [internal IP of a VM](../../compute/concepts/network.md#internal-ip) within one of the subnets.
    * `Gateway`, to send traffic through a [NAT gateway](./gateways.md#nat-gateway). For this gateway type, specify the name of an already existing NAT gateway on the cloud network.

If you create multiple entries with overlapping prefixes, the prefix with the larger subnet mask will have higher priority. For example, between two entries with the `172.16.0.0/20` and `172.16.0.0/24` destination prefixes, the entry with the `172.16.0.0/24` prefix will be used for sending traffic, as it has higher priority.

When creating a static route with an `IP address` as the `next hop`, you can specify an internal IP address previously unused in this cloud network. In this case, the virtual network will discard all traffic to the destination prefix of the route until you run a VM with that IP address.

Static routes can use the default route prefix: `0.0.0.0/0`.Â This means that all traffic not directed through more specific routes will be sent through the gateway IP address specified for this prefix.

When creating a static route with a `Gateway` as `next hop`, you can specify only the `0.0.0.0/0` default route prefix in the `Destination prefix`. This `next hop` type does not support other prefixes.


### Route priority in complex scenarios {#priority}

In complex routing scenarios with multiple default routes in the VPC network (subnets), outgoing traffic will follow this routing order:

* Priority 1: If you set up the default static route of `0.0.0.0/0`, it will have the highest priority.

* Priority 2: If a VM has a public IP address configured and there is no default static route (priority 1) in the subnet, traffic will be routed through that public IP address.

* Priority 3: If you set up the default static route of `0.0.0.0/0` through a [NAT gateway](./gateways.md#nat-gateway), it will have a lower priority than priorities 1 and 2.

* Priority 4: If you announce a default route of `0.0.0.0/0` using [Cloud Interconnect](../../interconnect/concepts/routing.md#cic-routing-default-as), it will be treated as having a lower priority than routes with priorities 1, 2, and 3.


## Limitations {#restrictions}

1. A {{ vpc-short-name }} route table can only have one entry per destination prefix. Duplicating destination prefixes within the same {{ vpc-short-name }} route table is not allowed. This also applies to the `0.0.0.0/0` default route prefix.
1. A virtual machine can access the internet and you can access the VM via a public IP address only if there is no `0.0.0.0/0` default static route in its subnet. If a virtual machine is behind a NAT instance, you can connect to it via an internal IP address, using the NAT instance as a jump host:

   ```bash
   ssh -J <NAT_instance_username>@<NAT_instance_public_IP_address> \
     <VM_user_name>@<VM_internal_IP_address>
   ```

1. {{ vpc-short-name }} route tables cannot use link-local IP address prefixes, such as `169.254.0.0/16` and more specific ones, as they are reserved for {{ vpc-name }} internal use.
1. You cannot use the IP address of a load balancer's [traffic listener](../../network-load-balancer/concepts/listener.md) as `next hop`.
1. When using {{ vpc-short-name }} route tables to route reverse traffic from [target resources](../../network-load-balancer/concepts/target-resources.md) of an internal load balancer, consider the [traffic routing specifics](../../network-load-balancer/concepts/specifics.md#nlb-int-routing).
1. You cannot use IP addresses of an application-level load balancer's [traffic listener](../../application-load-balancer/concepts/application-load-balancer.md#listener) as `next hop`.
1. A {{ yandex-cloud }} virtual network does not allow transmitting traffic through itself. In other words, only [private IP address ranges in {{ vpc-name }}](../../vpc/concepts/network.md#subnet) can be used as destination prefixes and gateways for static routes in {{ vpc-short-name }} route tables. Traffic to public destination prefixes or gateways with public IP addresses in the {{ vpc-short-name }} route table will be discarded.
1. To learn more about the quota-related restrictions on the use of route tables and static routes, see [Quotas and limits](./limits.md#vpc-quotas) in the {{ vpc-name }} documentation.
