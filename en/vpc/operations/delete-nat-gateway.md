# Deleting a NAT gateway

If you no longer need a NAT gateway, you can [delete it](#delete-nat-gateway). Before deleting a NAT gateway, [detach it](#unlink-nat-gateway) from all route tables that use it.

## Detaching a NAT gateway from a route table {#unlink-nat-gateway}

- Management console {#console}

  1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), go to the folder where you need to detach a NAT gateway.
  1. In the list of services, select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.iam.folder.dashboard.label_vpc }}**.
  1. In the left-hand panel, select ![image](../../_assets/console-icons/route.svg) **{{ ui-key.yacloud.vpc.network.switch_route-table }}**.
  1. In the list that opens, find the route table with the NAT gateway listed in its **Static routes** column.
  1. In the line with the appropriate table, click ![image](../../_assets/console-icons/ellipsis.svg) and select **Edit**.
  1. In the window that opens, click ![image](../../_assets/console-icons/xmark.svg) in the line with the NAT gateway name.
  1. Click **Save**.

  To detach a NAT gateway from a route table:

  1. View the description of the CLI command for editing a route table:

      ```bash
      yc vpc route-table update --help
      ```

  1. Get the name or ID of the route table the NAT gateway is attached to:

      ```bash
      yc vpc route-table list
      ```
      Result:
      ```text
      +----------------------+----------------------+-------------+----------------------+
      |          ID          |         NAME         | DESCRIPTION |      NETWORK-ID      |
      +----------------------+----------------------+-------------+----------------------+
      | enpcaaqahk3c******** | test-table           |             | enptgj64mv2r******** |
      +----------------------+----------------------+-------------+----------------------+

      ```
  1. Detach the NAT gateway:
      ```bash
      yc vpc route-table update <route_table_name_or_ID> --clear-routes
      ```
      Use either the `--id` or `--name` parameter.

- {{ TF }} {#tf}

  {% include [terraform-install](../../_includes/terraform-install.md) %}

  {% include [terraform-definition](../../_tutorials/_tutorials_includes/terraform-definition.md) %}

  To detach a NAT gateway from a route table created using {{ TF }}:

  1. Open the {{ TF }} configuration file and find the section with the description of the route table the NAT gateway is attached to:

      {% cut "Example of a table description in the {{ TF }} configuration" %}

     ```hcl
     ...
     resource "yandex_vpc_route_table" "routetable" {
       folder_id  = "<user_folder_ID>"
       name       = "<route_table_name>"
       network_id = "<network_ID>"
       static_route {
         destination_prefix = "0.0.0.0/0"
         gateway_id         = <gateway_ID>
       }
     }
     ...
     ```

     {% endcut %}

  1. Delete the `static_route` object.

  1. In the command line, go to the directory with the {{ TF }} configuration file.

  1. Check the configuration using this command:

     ```bash
     terraform validate
     ```

     If the configuration is correct, you will get this message:

     ```text
     Success! The configuration is valid.
     ```

  1. Run this command:

     ```bash
     terraform plan
     ```

     The terminal will display a list of resources with parameters. No changes will be made at this step. If the configuration contains any errors, {{ TF }} will point them out.

  1. Apply the configuration changes:

     ```bash
     terraform apply
     ```

  1. Confirm the changes: type `yes` into the terminal and press **Enter**.

     You can check the update using the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}) or this [CLI](../../cli/quickstart.md) command:

     ```bash
     yc vpc route-table get <route_table_name_or_ID>
     ```
     Use either the `--id` or `--name` parameter.

- API {#api}

  To detach a NAT gateway from a route table, delete the static route with that NAT gateway from the route table. To do this, use the [update](../api-ref/RouteTable/update.md) REST API method for the [RouteTable](../api-ref/RouteTable/index.md) resource or the [RouteTableService/Update](../api-ref/grpc/route_table_service.md#Update) gRPC API call. In your request, provide a list of static routes without the route you want to delete under:
    * `staticRoutes`: For REST API
    * `static_routes`: For gRPC API

  If the list contained a single static route, provide an empty list.

  To get a list of static routes, use the [get](../api-ref/RouteTable/get.md) REST API method for the [RouteTable](../api-ref/RouteTable/index.md) resource or the [RouteTableService/Get](../api-ref/grpc/route_table_service.md#Get) gRPC API call. In your request, provide the route table ID in this parameter:
    * `routeTableId`: For REST API
    * `route_table_id`: For gRPC API
