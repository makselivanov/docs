You can upload small data volumes (up to 100 MB) to your {{ ml-platform-name }} project through the {{ jlab }}Lab interface. We recommend uploading larger data volumes from network storages or databases. For large data volumes, [datasets](../../datasphere/concepts/dataset.md) make another convenient option.

To upload data to your project through the {{ jlab }}Lab interface:

1. In the ![folder](../../_assets/datasphere/jupyterlab/folder.svg) **File Browser** section, select a folder for the data.
1. Click ![upload](../../_assets/datasphere/jupyterlab/upload.svg) at the top left.
1. Select the files to upload.
