For example, Julia works with multiple teams and belongs to their communities with different access rights:
* In the <q>Cat lovers</q> community: `Admin` (the `{{ roles-datasphere-communities-admin }}` role).
* In the <q>Counting fences</q> community: `Developer` (the `{{ roles-datasphere-communities-developer }}` role).
* In the <q>Top secret</q> community: `Viewer` (the `{{ roles-datasphere-communities-viewer}}` role), but no `Editor` privilege in the <q>Project_111</q> project of this community (the `{{ roles-datasphere-project-editor }}` role).

Julia can:

* Share the resources of any project from the <q>Cat lovers</q> community in this community.
* Share the resources of any project from the <q>Cat lovers</q> community in the <q>Counting fences</q> community.
* She can also publish the <q>Project_111</q> resources in the <q>Cat lovers</q> and <q>Counting fences</q> communities, but cannot share them in the <q>Top secret</q> community.
