{% note warning %}

If you close the cluster from load and disable [background data redistribution](../../../../managed-greenplum/concepts/expand.md#setting-delay-redistribution), you will lose access to the cluster until its expansion is complete.

The expansion process can be [time-consuming](../../../../managed-greenplum/concepts/expand.md#duration).
