A VM's minimum configuration required to install and correctly run the {{ backup-name }} agent is as follows:

* Free disk space:

   * For Linux-based VMs: 2 GB.
   * For Windows-based VMs: 1.2 GB.

* RAM: For backups, 1 GB of RAM is required per TB of a backup. The amount of RAM used depends on the volume and type of data handled by the agent.
