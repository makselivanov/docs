#### Other restrictions {#functions-other-restrictions}

When installing dependencies:
* The total time for installing dependencies is limited to **five minutes**. After it expires, the build will fail with an error.
* For dependency installation, **1 GB** of RAM is allocated, of which **700 MB** is allocated for temporary file storage (tmpfs). Memory is consumed by active processes and files created and downloaded during the build.
* **50%** of the CPU is available.

If the build takes longer than five minutes or requires more resources, build the dependencies yourself and [download the function as a ZIP archive](../functions/operations/function/version-manage.md).
