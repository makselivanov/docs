By default, all videos are published after uploading, changing their status to `{{ ui-key.yacloud_video.videos.status_published }}`.

If you want to [unpublish a video](../../video/operations/video/unpublish.md), disable the **{{ ui-key.yacloud_video.videos.label_allow-access }}** option. The `{{ ui-key.yacloud_video.videos.label_visibility-status }}` field value will change to `{{ ui-key.yacloud_video.videos.status_unpublished }}` and your video will become unreachable via [links](../../video/operations/video/get-link.md).
