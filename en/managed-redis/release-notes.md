* {{ RD }} 5.0 and 6.0 are no longer supported. Clusters cannot be created in these versions. One month after the release of version 7.0, existing {{ RD }} 5.0 and 6.0 clusters will be automatically updated to version 6.2.

## Q1 2022 {#q1-2022}

* You can now create clusters with public access. You can enable or update this setting at the host level and only for clusters with TLS support. {{ tag-con }}
