  To delete a cluster, use the [delete](../api-ref/Cluster/delete.md) REST API method for the [Cluster](../api-ref/Cluster/index.md) resource or the [ClusterService/Delete](../api-ref/grpc/cluster_service.md#Delete) gRPC API call and provide the ID of the cluster to delete in the `clusterId` request parameter.

  You can get the cluster ID with a [list of clusters](cluster-list.md#list-clusters).
