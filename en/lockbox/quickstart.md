# Getting started with {{ lockbox-name }}


Create your first secret and get its contents.

A secret is a set of versions that store your data. A version contains sets of keys and values:
* A key is a non-secret name that identifies a value.
* The value is your secret data.

Versions can't be changed. Whenever you need to change the number of key-value pairs or their contents, you must create a new version.

## Creating secrets {#secret}

{% include [secret-create](../_includes/lockbox/secret-create.md) %}

## Getting the contents of a secret {#get}

### Roles required to get a secret {#roles}

{% include [lockbox-and-kms-roles](../_includes/lockbox/lockbox-and-kms-roles.md) %}

### Get the contents of the secret {#payload}

{% list tabs group=instructions %}

- Management console {#console}

    1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select the folder the secret belongs to.
    1. In the list of services, select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.iam.folder.dashboard.label_lockbox }}**.
    1. In the left-hand menu, select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.lockbox.label_section-secrets }}**.
    1. Click the name of the secret you need.
    1. Under **{{ ui-key.yacloud.lockbox.label_secret-versions-section }}**, click the secret version you need.

- CLI {#cli}

  {% include [cli-install](../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

  {% include [default-catalogue](../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

  1. View a description of the CLI command to get the contents of a secret:

      ```bash
      yc lockbox payload get --help
      ```

  1. {% include [get-secret-id](../_includes/lockbox/get-secret-id.md) %}

  1. Run this command:

      ```bash
      yc lockbox payload get \
        --id <secret_ID> \
        --key <secret_key> \
        --version-id <secret_version_ID>
      ```

      Where:

      * `--id`: Secret ID. This is a required parameter.
      * `--key`: Secret contents key required to get the single value. This is an optional parameter.
      * `--version-id`: Secret version. This is an optional parameter. Defaults to the current secret version.

      An example of a command used to get the contents of a secret:

      ```bash
      yc lockbox payload get \
        --id e6qetpqfe8vv******** \
        --version-id e6qqr7k79ecm********
      ```

      In this example, you get the contents of the `e6qqr7k79ecm********` secret version.

      Result:

      ```text
      version_id: e6qqr7k79ecm********
      entries:
        - key: first_key
          text_value: value_1
        - key: second_key
          text_value: value_2
      ```

- API {#api}

    If you make a request without specifying a version, the contents of the current (latest) version is returned.

    You can use this logic in scripts, services, and applications where you need to use the contents of your secret.

    To get the contents of the secret:
    1. [Get an IAM token](../iam/operations/iam-token/create.md) required for authentication and save it to the variable:

        ```
        export IAM_TOKEN=$(yc iam create-token)
        ```

        You can also get an IAM token for your service account from inside the VM the token is linked to. To do this, send a request to the [metadata service](../compute/operations/vm-info/get-info.md#request-examples). An example with the [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) utility:
        
        ```
        export IAM_TOKEN=$(curl -H Metadata-Flavor:Google http://169.254.169.254/computeMetadata/v1/instance/service-accounts/default/token | jq -r .access_token)
        ```

    1. Run the following query:

        ```
        curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer ${IAM_TOKEN}" \
        https://{{ api-host-lockbox-payload }}/lockbox/v1/secrets/<secret_ID>/payload
        ```
{% endlist %}

You can manage secrets and their contents not only through the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), [CLI](../cli/quickstart.md), and [API](../overview/api.md), but also using SDKs for popular programming languages. For more information, see [{#T}](./concepts/index.md#interface).
