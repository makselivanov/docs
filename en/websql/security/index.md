# Access management in {{ websql-name }}

In this section, you will learn:

* [Which resources you can assign a role for](#resources).
* [Which roles exist in the service](#roles-list).
* [Which roles are required](#required-roles) for particular actions.

{% include [about-access-management](../../_includes/iam/about-access-management.md) %}

Roles for a resource can be assigned by users who have the `websql.admin` role or one of the following roles for that resource:

{% include [roles-list](../../_includes/iam/roles-list.md) %}

## Which resources you can assign a role for {#resources}

{% include [basic-resources](../../_includes/iam/basic-resources-for-access-control.md) %}

You can also assign roles to saved and historical queries you published.

## Which roles exist in the service {#roles-list}

You can use {{ websql-full-name }} roles (_service roles_) and {{ yandex-cloud }} roles (_primitive roles_) to manage query access permissions.
