# Adding a dictionary to a tag

After [creating a dictionary](create.md), you can edit a [tag](../../concepts/tags.md) and add the [dictionary](../../concepts/dictionaries.md) to it. The tag will then apply to conversations containing trigger phrases from the dictionary.

You can also add a dictionary when [creating a tag](../project/tag/create.md#new-tag).

To change a project tag, you need either the `{{ roles-speechsense-admin }}` or the `{{ roles-speechsense-editor }}` role for the project.

To add a dictionary to an existing tag:

1. Open the {{ speechsense-name }} [home page]({{ link-speechsense-main }}).
1. Go to the space you need and select a project.
1. On the **Tags** tab, click the line with the tag.
1. In the window that opens, click ![icon](../../../_assets/console-icons/book-open.svg) **Add dictionary** in the **Key phrases** field.
1. Select the dictionaries you need from the drop-down list.
1. Click **Apply** and then **Save**.
