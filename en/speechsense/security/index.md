# Access management in {{ speechsense-name }}

User access to {{ speechsense-full-name }} depends on relevant permissions granted within an organization. Organizations are managed using [{{ org-full-name }}](../../organization/).

The operations available to {{ speechsense-name }} users are determined by their roles. You can assign roles to a Yandex account, [service account](../../iam/concepts/users/service-accounts.md), [federated users](../../iam/concepts/federations.md), [user group](../../organization/operations/manage-groups.md), [system group](../../iam/concepts/access-control/system-group.md), or [public group](../../iam/concepts/access-control/public-group.md). For more information about managing access to {{ yandex-cloud }}, see [{#T}](../../iam/concepts/access-control/index.md).

Only users with the `admin`, `resource-manager.clouds.owner`, or `organization-manager.organizations.owner` role for a resource can assign roles for this resource.

## Which resources you can assign a role for {#resources}

You can assign a role for a space or a project. Roles assigned for a space also apply to all nested projects and resources.

## What roles do I need {#choosing-roles}
