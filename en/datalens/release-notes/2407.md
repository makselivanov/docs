# {{ datalens-full-name }} release notes: July 2024

* [Updates](#updates)
* [Fixes and improvements](#fixes)

## Updates {#updates}



### Grouping selectors on dashboards {#group-controls}

You can now group multiple [selectors](../dashboard/selector.md) within a single widget on the dashboard.

You can configure additional control buttons for widgets with one or more selectors:

* **Apply button**: Applies the values of all selectors in the widget. The selector values are not applied until you click the button.
* **Reset button**: Resets the values of all selectors in the widget to their defaults.

For a widget with multiple selectors, you can configure their order and layout. You can set the width of each selector in pixels or as a percentage of the widget's total width. Specifying `100%` for each selector will create a vertical group. For more information, see [{#T}](../operations/dashboard/add-selector.md).
