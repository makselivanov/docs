# Pricing policy for Managed Service for Elasticsearch



{% include [Elasticsearch-end-of-service](../_includes/mdb/mes/note-end-of-service.md) %}

In this section, you can find the {{ mes-name }} pricing [policy](#rules) and [effective prices](#prices) for its resources.

{% include [use-calculator](../_includes/pricing/use-calculator.md) %}

{% include [link-to-price-list](../_includes/pricing/link-to-price-list.md) %}

{% include [currency-choice](../_includes/pricing/currency-choice.md) %}

## Cluster status {#running-stopped}

Prices are applied differently depending on the cluster status:

* For a `Running` cluster, you pay for both the computing resources and your storage size.
* For a `Stopped` cluster, you only pay for your storage size.

{% include [pricing-status-warning.md](../_includes/mdb/pricing-status-warning.md) %}


## What goes into the cost of using {{ mes-short-name }} {#rules}

The {{ mes-name }} usage cost is based on:

* {{ ES }} edition in use.

* Computing resources allocated to cluster hosts (including hosts with the `Master node` role).

* Disk type and disk space.

* Egress traffic from {{ yandex-cloud }}.

{% include [pricing-gb-size](../_includes/pricing-gb-size.md) %}

### Using cluster hosts {#rules-hosts-uptime}

The cost is calculated for each hour of operation of the host in accordance with the allocated computing resources and {{ ES }} edition used. You can find the supported resource configurations in the [Host classes](concepts/instance-types.md) section. For vCPU and RAM prices, see [Prices](#prices).

You can select a host class both for hosts with the `Data node` role and those with the `Master node` role.

The minimum billing unit is one minute (for example, 1.5 minutes of host operation cost the same as 2 minutes). You do not pay for the time when the {{ ES }} host is unable to perform its main functions.

### Disk space usage {#rules-storage}

You pay for the following:

* Storage allocated for clusters.

* Storage taken up by backups over specified cluster storage.

  * Backups are stored free of charge as long as the combined size of the data in the cluster and all backups is smaller than the selected storage size.

  * When performing automatic backups, {{ mes-short-name }} does not create a new copy but saves the data changed from the previous backup. It means the storage space used by automatic backups only increases in proportion to the volume of changes.

  * The number of hosts in a cluster does not affect the storage volume and, consequently, the free volume of backups.

The price covers one month of use based on 720 hours per month. The minimum billing unit is 1 GB per minute (for example, storing 1 GB for 1.5 minutes costs the same as storing 1 GB for 2 minutes).

### Example of cluster cost calculation {#example}

The cost of using a cluster with the following parameters for 30 days:

* **Hosts** with the `Data node` role: Three hosts of the `s2.micro` class: 2 × 100% vCPU, 8 GB RAM.
* **Hosts** with the `Master node` role: Three hosts of the `s2.micro` class: 2 × 100% vCPU, 8 GB RAM.
* **Storage**: 100 GB of network HDD storage.

The cost is calculated as follows:



> 3 × (2&nbsp;×&nbsp;$0.013440 + 8&nbsp;×&nbsp;$0.016800) + 3 × (2&nbsp;×&nbsp;$0.013440 + 8&nbsp;×&nbsp;$0.016800) = $0.967680
>
> Total: $0.967680, cost of operation of all hosts per hour.

Where:
* 3: Number of hosts.
* 2: Number of vCPUs
* $0.013440: Cost of using 100% vCPU per hour.
* 8: Amount of RAM per host (in GB).
* $0.016800: Cost of using 1 GB of RAM at 100% vCPU per hour.

> 720 × $0.967680 + 100 × $0.025600 = $699.289600
>
> Total: $699.289600, cost of using the cluster for 30 days.

Where:
* 720: Number of hours in 30 days
* $0.967680: Cost of operation of all hosts per hour.
* 100: Amount of network HDD storage (in GB)
* $0.025600: Cost of using 1 GB of network HDD storage per month



## Prices for the Russia region {#prices}

{% note info %}

As of June 13, 2022, the `Gold` [edition](./concepts/es-editions.md) has been discontinued in {{ mes-name }} clusters. You cannot create a new cluster with this edition or switch to it from `Basic` or `Platinum`. On July 6, 2022, all `Gold` clusters were automatically upgraded to `Platinum` at the same price until the end of 2022.
