[DDoS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack) (Distributed Denial of Service) is a cyberattack that involves sending massive numbers of requests to a server or network to overwhelm it or render it inoperable.

In this tutorial, you will deploy a DDoS protection infrastructure for app backends in {{ yandex-cloud }}.
